Good! I can see I'm on the Postmill forum homepage. The page shows:
- I'm logged in as "MarvelsGrantMan136"
- There's a red navigation bar with "Postmill", "Forums", "Wiki" options
- A "+ Submit" button in the top right
- The page shows "You are not subscribed to any forum. Showing featured forums instead."

My task is to post in a technology forum about what open-source LLMs could help the corresponding field. I need to:
1. First, find and navigate to the technology forum
2. Create a post about open-source LLMs

Let me click on "Forums" to see what forums are available.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '47572926-6338-4495-b4a9-5343a6cd4e0b', 'target': 'Forums link in the red navigation bar at the top'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the URL has changed to "/forums" but the page still shows the same content. It seems the page hasn't fully loaded yet. Let me scroll down to see if there are any forums listed below.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '47572926-6338-4495-b4a9-5343a6cd4e0b', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I can see the list of forums. At the top, there's a "technology" forum with "/r/technology" as the link. This is exactly what I need. Let me click on it to enter the technology forum.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '47572926-6338-4495-b4a9-5343a6cd4e0b', 'target': 'technology link text in the first forum entry'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the URL changed to "/r/technology" but I'm still seeing the list of forums. Let me scroll up to see if there's a view of the technology forum or if I need to use the Submit button to create a post.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '47572926-6338-4495-b4a9-5343a6cd4e0b', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled up by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! Now I'm in the technology forum (/r/technology). I can see existing posts about various technology topics. To create a new post about open-source LLMs, I need to click the "+ Submit" button in the top right corner.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '47572926-6338-4495-b4a9-5343a6cd4e0b', 'target': '+ Submit button in the red navigation bar at the top right'}

Perfect! The submission form has loaded. I can see:
- A URL field (optional)
- A Title field (required - marked with *)
- A Body field for the content
- The Forum is already set to "technology"
- A "Create submission" button

Now I need to create a post about what open-source LLMs could help the corresponding field (technology). Let me fill in the form. I'll start by clicking on the Title field and entering a title.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '47572926-6338-4495-b4a9-5343a6cd4e0b', 'target': 'Title text input field below the Title label'}

Good! The Title field is now focused (I can see the red border around it). Now I'll type a title about open-source LLMs and their potential to help the technology field.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {'boxId': '47572926-6338-4495-b4a9-5343a6cd4e0b', 'content': 'How Open-Source LLMs Could Help the Technology Field', 'pressEnterAfterType': False}
[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! The title "How Open-Source LLMs Could Help the Technology Field" has been entered. Now I need to click on the Body field and write content about what open-source LLMs could help with in the technology field.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '47572926-6338-4495-b4a9-5343a6cd4e0b', 'target': 'Body text area field below the Body label'}
