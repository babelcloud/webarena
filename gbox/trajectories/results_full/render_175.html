Good! I can see I'm on a GitLab dashboard showing projects. The task is to find my latest updated issue that has the keyword "dependency" in its title and check if it is closed.

I need to navigate to the Issues section to find issues with "dependency" in the title. Let me click on the hamburger menu or look for an Issues link. I can see there's a navigation menu at the top. Let me click on the hamburger menu icon to access Issues.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'Hamburger menu icon with three horizontal lines at the top left, next to the GitLab logo'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
It looks like the menu didn't open as expected, or the page is still loading. Let me look for another way to navigate to Issues. I notice there's a navigation bar at the top with some icons. Let me try clicking on the issues icon or look for a direct link to issues. Let me check the top navigation bar more carefully.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'Icon in the top navigation bar that looks like a clipboard or list icon, likely representing issues'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! The menu opened. I can see options like Projects, Groups, Milestones, Snippets, and Activity. I need to find Issues. Let me look for an Issues option. I notice there's an "Activity" option which might show recent activity including issues. However, I should look for a more direct way to access Issues. Let me click somewhere else to close this menu and try a different approach.

Let me close this menu and look for a direct Issues link in the navigation.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'keys': ['escape']}
[result] Keys pressed successfully
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608'}
[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good, the menu is closed. I can see I'm on the Projects Dashboard. I notice in the top navigation bar there are several icons. Let me look for the Issues icon. I can see icons that show "1", "2", "3" with different symbols. Let me try clicking on the icon that looks like it could be for issues (often represented by an exclamation mark or clipboard icon in GitLab).
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'Icon in the top navigation bar that shows a number next to what appears to be an issues or tasks icon'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Great! I can see the URL has changed to include "dashboard/issues?assignee_username=byteblaze" which suggests I'm now looking at issues assigned to the user "byteblaze". However, the page still shows the Projects view. Let me wait for the page to load or try clicking directly on a more visible link.

Let me try using the search functionality or navigating more directly. I'll click on the search bar and search for issues with "dependency" in the title.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'Search GitLab text box in the top navigation bar with magnifying glass icon'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I can see the Issues Dashboard has loaded. I can see a list of issues and I notice there's one issue with "dependencies" in the title:

**"Outdated dependencies"** - byteblaze/empathy-prompts#18 - created 4 years ago by Byte Blaze - updated 2 years ago

This issue has labels: [Priority] Critical, [Status] Submitted, [Type] Bug

I can see this issue was updated 2 years ago. Now I need to check if this is indeed my latest updated issue with "dependency" in the title, and then check if it's closed. Let me look for a way to filter or search specifically for issues with "dependency" in the title to make sure this is the most recent one.

Let me type "dependency" in the search box to filter issues:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'content': 'dependency'}
[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I typed "dependency" in the search box and I can see a dropdown appeared showing "dependency in all GitLab". I can also see at the top there are tabs showing:
- Open: 12
- Closed: 53
- All: 65

The issues are currently filtered by "Assignee = Byte Blaze". I can still see the "Outdated dependencies" issue in the list. Now let me press Enter or click on the search suggestion to search for issues with "dependency" in them.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'keys': ['enter']}
[result] Keys pressed successfully

[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I can see a search page has loaded. On the left side, I can see:
- Projects: 0
- Issues: 99+
- Merge requests: 99+
- Milestones: 0
- Users: 0

There are 99+ issues matching "dependency". Let me click on "Issues" to see the list of issues with "dependency" in them.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'Issues link in the left sidebar showing 99+ results'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
It seems the page is still loading or the click didn't navigate to the issues list. Let me wait a moment for the page to load, then try clicking on Issues again.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Great! Now I can see the issues list has loaded. I can see several issues with "dependency" or related keywords. On the left side, I can see filters for:
- Status: Any status, Open, Closed
- Confidentiality options

I notice the URL has changed to include "scope=issues&search=dependency". I can see several issues listed, but I need to focus on finding issues that have "dependency" in the title specifically, and I need to find MY issues (assigned to me or created by me).

The current view shows "Created date" as the sort order. However, I need to find the latest UPDATED issue with "dependency" in the title. Let me click on the "Created date" dropdown to change it to "Updated date".
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'Created date dropdown button in the top right area showing sort options'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! The dropdown menu opened showing:
- Created date (currently selected with checkmark)
- Updated date
- Popularity

I need to click on "Updated date" to sort by the latest updated issues.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'Updated date option in the dropdown menu'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the URL has changed to include "&sort=updated_desc" which means it should now be sorted by updated date in descending order (newest updates first). However, the page seems to still show the same issues. The dropdown still shows "Created date". Let me wait for the page to fully load and then take a screenshot to see the updated results.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! Now the page has loaded and is sorted by "Updated date". I can see several issues with "dependency" or "dependencies" in their titles. Let me examine the visible issues:

1. **"Outdated dependencies"** (Open) - Byte Blaze / empathy-prompts #18 - created 4 years ago by Byte Blaze - **updated 2 years ago**

2. **"Remove unused vendor dependencies"** (Closed) - Byte Blaze / empathy-prompts #5 - created 8 years ago by Byte Blaze - **updated 2 years ago**

3. **"Remove Gulp as a dependency"** (Open) - The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com #989 - created 5 years ago by Byte Blaze - **updated 2 years ago**

4. **"drbbdup does not restore regs at last instruction of a rep-expanded block"** (Open) - DynamoRIO / dynamorio #5906 - created 2 years ago by prasun3 - **updated 2 years ago**

5. **"Add instruction encoding entries to drmemtrace"** (Closed) - DynamoRIO / dynamorio #5520 - created 3 years ago by Derek Bruening - **updated 2 years ago**

6. **"Reduce glibc dependences in drrun to operate on older distros"** (Closed) - DynamoRIO / dynamorio #5474 - created 3 years ago by Derek Bruening - **updated 2 years ago**

All of these show "updated 2 years ago". Now I need to identify which issues are MINE (created by me or assigned to me). Looking at the creators, I can see "Byte Blaze" appears to be the user. Let me look for issues specifically with "dependency" (singular) in the title that are mine.

The first issue "Outdated dependencies" is:
- Created by: Byte Blaze
- Project: Byte Blaze / empathy-prompts #18
- Status: Open (green label)
- Updated: 2 years ago

This appears to be the latest updated issue with "dependenc" in the title that belongs to Byte Blaze. Now I need to click on this issue to check its full details and confirm if it's closed or open.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'Outdated dependencies issue link at the top of the issues list'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the URL has changed to "byteblaze/empathy-prompts/-/issues/18" which indicates I clicked on the issue. However, the page still shows the search results. Let me wait for the page to load the issue details.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! The issue page has loaded. I can now see the full details of the issue "Outdated dependencies" (#18):

**Key Information:**
- **Title:** Outdated dependencies
- **Status:** Open (green label showing "Open" at the top)
- **Project:** empathy-prompts
- **Issue #:** 18

- **Description:** "The version of Gulp I use is no longer supported. I'll need to replatform this before any more issues can be addressed."

**Answer:** The issue is **NOT closed** - it is **OPEN**.

Looking at the top of the page, there's a green "Open" badge next to the issue creation information, and there's also a "Close issue" button available, which confirms this issue is currently open.

Now let me call the complete_task function with the answer:
[tool] mcp__task-completion__complete_task: {'finalAnswer': 'No, the issue is not closed. The latest updated issue with "dependency" in the title ("Outdated dependencies" #18 in empathy-prompts) is currently Open.'}
[complete] No, the issue is not closed. The latest updated issue with \"dependency\" in the title (\"Outdated dependencies\" #18 in empathy-prompts) is currently Open.

On the left side, I can see filters for:\n- Status: Any status, Open, Closed\n- Confidentiality options\n\nI notice the URL has changed to include "scope=issues&search=dependency". I can see several issues listed, but I need to focus on finding issues that have "dependency" in the title specifically, and I need to find MY issues (assigned to me or created by me).\n\nThe current view shows "Created date" as the sort order. However, I need to find the latest UPDATED issue with "dependency" in the title. Let me click on the "Created date" dropdown to change it to "Updated date".\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'target\': \'Created date dropdown button in the top right area showing sort options\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect! The dropdown menu opened showing:\n- Created date (currently selected with checkmark)\n- Updated date\n- Popularity\n\nI need to click on "Updated date" to sort by the latest updated issues.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'target\': \'Updated date option in the dropdown menu\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI can see the URL has changed to include "&sort=updated_desc" which means it should now be sorted by updated date in descending order (newest updates first). However, the page seems to still show the same issues. The dropdown still shows "Created date". Let me wait for the page to fully load and then take a screenshot to see the updated results.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'duration\': 2000}\n[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nExcellent! Now the page has loaded and is sorted by "Updated date". I can see several issues with "dependency" or "dependencies" in their titles. Let me examine the visible issues:\n\n1. **"Outdated dependencies"** (Open) - Byte Blaze / empathy-prompts #18 - created 4 years ago by Byte Blaze - **updated 2 years ago**\n\n2. **"Remove unused vendor dependencies"** (Closed) - Byte Blaze / empathy-prompts #5 - created 8 years ago by Byte Blaze - **updated 2 years ago**\n\n3. **"Remove Gulp as a dependency"** (Open) - The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com #989 - created 5 years ago by Byte Blaze - **updated 2 years ago**\n\n4. **"drbbdup does not restore regs at last instruction of a rep-expanded block"** (Open) - DynamoRIO / dynamorio #5906 - created 2 years ago by prasun3 - **updated 2 years ago**\n\n5. **"Add instruction encoding entries to drmemtrace"** (Closed) - DynamoRIO / dynamorio #5520 - created 3 years ago by Derek Bruening - **updated 2 years ago**\n\n6. **"Reduce glibc dependences in drrun to operate on older distros"** (Closed) - DynamoRIO / dynamorio #5474 - created 3 years ago by Derek Bruening - **updated 2 years ago**\n\nAll of these show "updated 2 years ago". Now I need to identify which issues are MINE (created by me or assigned to me). Looking at the creators, I can see "Byte Blaze" appears to be the user. Let me look for issues specifically with "dependency" (singular) in the title that are mine.\n\nThe first issue "Outdated dependencies" is:\n- Created by: Byte Blaze\n- Project: Byte Blaze / empathy-prompts #18\n- Status: Open (green label)\n- Updated: 2 years ago\n\nThis appears to be the latest updated issue with "dependenc" in the title that belongs to Byte Blaze. Now I need to click on this issue to check its full details and confirm if it\'s closed or open.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'target\': \'Outdated dependencies issue link at the top of the issues list\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI can see the URL has changed to "byteblaze/empathy-prompts/-/issues/18" which indicates I clicked on the issue.
