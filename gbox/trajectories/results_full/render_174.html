Good! I can see I'm on the GitLab dashboard showing a list of projects. I need to find issues with "feature" in the title. To do this, I should navigate to the Issues section. Let me click on the Issues icon in the navigation bar.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Issues icon in the left sidebar navigation menu'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I'm still on the Projects page. Let me click on the hamburger menu (three horizontal lines) to access the full navigation menu where I can find the Issues section.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Hamburger menu icon with three horizontal lines in the top left corner near the GitLab logo'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! The menu opened. I can see several options including "Projects", "Groups", and under "Explore" there are "Milestones", "Snippets", and "Activity". However, I don't see an "Issues" option in this menu. Let me look for it elsewhere. In GitLab, issues are typically accessed either through the main navigation or by going into a specific project. Let me close this menu and look for an Issues link in the top navigation bar.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Hamburger menu icon with three horizontal lines in the top left corner to close the menu'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good, the menu is closed. Now I need to find the Issues section. In GitLab, there's usually an "Issues" link in the top navigation. I can see icons in the top right area. Let me look for an Issues icon or link. I notice there are several icons on the right side of the navigation bar. Let me check if there's an Issues section by looking at the navigation more carefully. Actually, let me try clicking on what appears to be a checklist or issues icon in the top navigation bar.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Icon that looks like a checklist with a badge showing "11" in the top right navigation bar'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I can see the URL has changed to include "issues" and the tab title now shows "Issues - Dashboard - GitLab". However, the page content still shows the Projects list. Let me wait a moment for the page to load and then take a screenshot to see the Issues dashboard.

Excellent! I can now see the Issues dashboard. I can see several issues with "feature" in their titles. Looking at the "Updated date" column on the right, I need to find the most recently updated issue that has "feature" in its title. 

I can see several issues with "[Feature suggestion]" in their titles. The list shows:
1. "Tm Theme Editor" - updated 2 years ago
2. "[Feature suggestion] Support linking to an accessibility statement" - updated 2 years ago
3. "[Feature suggestion] WCAG trash panda mode" - updated 2 years ago
4. "[Feature suggestion] Add a submission form" - updated 2 years ago
5. "[Feature suggestion] Color theme slider" - updated 2 years ago
6. "Outdated dependencies" - updated 2 years ago

All of these show "updated 2 years ago". I notice the list is sorted by "Updated date" (I can see the dropdown at the top right). However, I need to look more carefully to see which one is the MOST recently updated. Let me check if I need to scroll down to see more issues, or if I can filter/sort differently to find the latest one.

Actually, looking more carefully at the current sort, the issues are already sorted by "Updated date" (as shown in the dropdown on the right). The issues at the top of the list should be the most recently updated. But they all show "updated 2 years ago". Let me click on the first feature suggestion issue to check its details.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': '[Feature suggestion] Support linking to an accessibility statement'}

I can see the URL changed to "/byteblaze/a11y-webring.club/-/issues/71", but the page is still showing the issues list. Let me wait for the page to load.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'duration': 2000}

[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I can now see the issue details. This is issue #71: "[Feature suggestion] Support linking to an accessibility statement". 

I can see important information:
- Status: **Open** (shown by the green "Open" badge at the top)
- The issue is NOT closed

However, I need to verify if this is indeed the LATEST updated issue with "feature" in the title. Let me go back to the issues list to check the other feature issues and compare their update times more carefully. Let me click the back button or navigate back to the issues list.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Issues link in the left sidebar'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I'm still on the same issue page. Let me click on "List" in the left sidebar to go back to the issues list view.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'List link in the left sidebar under Issues'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! Now I'm viewing the issues list for the "a11y-webring.club" project specifically. I can see 4 feature suggestion issues:

1. "[Feature suggestion] Support linking to an accessibility statement" #71 - updated 2 years ago
2. "[Feature suggestion] WCAG trash panda mode" #39 - updated 2 years ago
3. "[Feature suggestion] Add a submission form" #30 - updated 2 years ago
4. "[Feature suggestion] Color theme slider" #21 - updated 2 years ago

All show "updated 2 years ago". However, I need to go back to the dashboard view that shows ALL issues across ALL projects to find the latest updated issue with "feature" in the title. Let me navigate back to the Issues dashboard.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Icon that looks like a checklist with a badge showing "13" in the top right navigation bar'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I'm still in the project-specific view. I can see the URL shows it's still the a11y-webring.club project issues. Let me click on the GitLab logo to go to the dashboard home, and then access the global issues view.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'GitLab fox logo in the top left corner'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I'm back at the global Issues dashboard showing all issues across all projects. I can see the issues are sorted by "Updated date" (shown in the dropdown on the right). Looking at the list, I can see several issues with "feature" in their titles, and they all show "updated 2 years ago".

However, I need to look more carefully at the exact timing. The "Updated date" dropdown is showing the current sort. Let me examine the visible feature suggestion issues more closely. Looking at the top of the list, I can see:

1. "Tm Theme Editor" - updated 2 years ago (no "feature" in title)
2. "[Feature suggestion] Support linking to an accessibility statement" - updated 2 years ago
3. "[Feature suggestion] WCAG trash panda mode" - updated 2 years ago
4. "[Feature suggestion] Add a submission form" - updated 2 years ago
5. "[Feature suggestion] Color theme slider" - updated 2 years ago

Since they all show "updated 2 years ago", the first feature suggestion in the list (which is sorted by updated date) should be the most recently updated one. That would be "[Feature suggestion] Support linking to an accessibility statement" at issue #71.

I already checked that issue and saw it was **Open** (not closed). Let me verify this is correct by clicking on it again to double-check its status.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': '[Feature suggestion] Support linking to an accessibility statement'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
It navigated back to the Projects page. Let me go back to the Issues dashboard by clicking the issues icon again.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Icon that looks like a checklist with a badge showing "13" in the top right navigation bar'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The page is still showing the Projects view even though the URL indicates it should be showing issues. Let me wait for the page to load properly.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'duration': 2000}

[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! Now I'm back at the Issues dashboard. Looking at the list, I can see all the issues with "feature" in their titles show "updated 2 years ago". Since the list is sorted by "Updated date", the first feature suggestion should be the most recently updated.

However, I notice that "[Feature suggestion] Support linking to an accessibility statement" is the second item in the list (the first is "Tm Theme Editor" which doesn't have "feature" in the title). Let me click on this issue to verify its status.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': '[Feature suggestion] Support linking to an accessibility statement link text in the issues list'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The URL changed to the issue page (issues/71), but the page is still showing the issues list. Let me wait and scroll down or refresh to see if the issue details load.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'duration': 2000}
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I can see the issue details page has loaded. I can see clearly at the top of the page:

- **Status badge: "Open"** (green badge shown at the top)
- **Title: "[Feature suggestion] Support linking to an accessibility statement"**

This issue is **NOT closed** - it is **Open**.

However, I should verify that this is indeed the MOST RECENTLY updated issue with "feature" in the title. Let me scroll back to the top to see if there's more specific date/time information, or I should go back to the issues list and check more carefully for the exact dates.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled up by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I can clearly see this issue's status:
- **Status: Open** (green badge at the top)
- **Title: "[Feature suggestion] Support linking to an accessibility statement"**
- **Issue #71**

The status shows it is **NOT closed** - it is currently **Open**.

However, I need to make absolutely sure this is the LATEST updated issue with "feature" in the title. Let me navigate back to the issues dashboard and check if there are any other feature issues that might have been updated more recently. Let me use the browser's back navigation to return to the issues list.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'keys': ['alt', 'arrowLeft']}
[result] Keys pressed successfully
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c'}
[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I'm back at the Issues dashboard. Now I can see the full list sorted by "Updated date". Looking at the issues with "feature" in their titles, I can see:

1. **"[Feature suggestion] Support linking to an accessibility statement"** - updated 2 years ago
2. **"[Feature suggestion] WCAG trash panda mode"** - updated 2 years ago  
3. **"[Feature suggestion] Add a submission form"** - updated 2 years ago
4. **"[Feature suggestion] Color theme slider"** - updated 2 years ago

All feature suggestions show "updated 2 years ago". Since the list is sorted by "Updated date" in descending order (most recent first), and "[Feature suggestion] Support linking to an accessibility statement" is the first feature issue in the list, it should be the most recently updated.

However, I notice all these times say "2 years ago" which is quite vague. Let me click on the "Updated date" dropdown to see if I can get more precise sorting or check if there are more specific timestamps. Actually, I should verify my finding is correct by checking if this is truly the latest. Let me hover over the update time to see if there's a tooltip with more specific information.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__hover: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'updated 2 years ago text on the right side of the [Feature suggestion] Support linking to an accessibility statement row'}
[result] Hover action completed successfully. Moved to "updated 2 years ago text on the right side of the [Feature suggestion] Support linking to an accessibility statement row" at (1202, 363) {'type': 'image'
The hover didn't show a tooltip. Based on what I can see, the issues list is sorted by "Updated date" and "[Feature suggestion] Support linking to an accessibility statement" is the first feature issue in the list. Since the sort order typically shows most recent first, this appears to be the latest updated feature issue.

I already confirmed that this issue (#71) is **Open** (not closed).

However, to be thorough and ensure I have the correct answer, let me check if there are any feature issues on subsequent pages or if I need to scroll down to see if there are any more recent ones. Let me scroll down to check if there are more issues below.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'long'}
[result] Scrolled down by long distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good, I can see more issues below. I can see all the feature suggestions I saw before, and they all show "updated 2 years ago". There are no other issues with "feature" in their title visible in this portion. Let me continue scrolling to check if there are any more.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'long'}
[result] Scrolled down by long distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The page doesn't seem to be scrolling further - I'm seeing the same content. This appears to be all the issues. Looking at the complete list, the feature suggestion issues I can see are:

1. "[Feature suggestion] Support linking to an accessibility statement" #71 - updated 2 years ago
2. "[Feature suggestion] WCAG trash panda mode" #39 - updated 2 years ago
3. "[Feature suggestion] Add a submission form" #30 - updated 2 years ago
4. "[Feature suggestion] Color theme slider" #21 - updated 2 years ago

Since the list is sorted by "Updated date" in descending order (most recent first), and "[Feature suggestion] Support linking to an accessibility statement" is the first feature issue appearing in the list, it is the latest updated issue with "feature" in the title.

I have already verified that this issue (#71) is **Open** (not closed).

Therefore, the answer to the task "Open my latest updated issue that has keyword 'feature' in its title to check if it is closed" is:

**The issue is NOT closed - it is Open.**
[tool] mcp__task-completion__complete_task: {'finalAnswer': 'No'}
[complete] No
Perfect! I've completed the task. The latest updated issue with "feature" in its title is "[Feature suggestion] Support linking to an accessibility statement" (issue #71), and it is **NOT closed** - the status shows it is **Open**.</pre></div><div class='action_object' style='background-color:grey'><pre>{'action_type': <ActionTypes.STOP: 17>, 'coords': array([0., 0.], dtype=float32), 'element_role': 0, 'element_name': '', 'text': [], 'page_number': 0, 'url': '', 'nth': 0, 'pw_code': '', 'element_id': '', 'key_comb': '', 'direction': '', 'answer': 'No', 'raw_prediction': 'I\'ll help you find and check the latest updated issue with "feature" in its title.

Let me close this menu and look for an Issues link in the top navigation bar.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'target\': \'Hamburger menu icon with three horizontal lines in the top left corner to close the menu\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood, the menu is closed. Now I need to find the Issues section. In GitLab, there\'s usually an "Issues" link in the top navigation. I can see icons in the top right area. Let me look for an Issues icon or link. I notice there are several icons on the right side of the navigation bar. Let me check if there\'s an Issues section by looking at the navigation more carefully. Actually, let me try clicking on what appears to be a checklist or issues icon in the top navigation bar.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'target\': \'Icon that looks like a checklist with a badge showing "11" in the top right navigation bar\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect! I can see the URL has changed to include "issues" and the tab title now shows "Issues - Dashboard - GitLab". However, the page content still shows the Projects list. Let me wait a moment for the page to load and then take a screenshot to see the Issues dashboard.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'duration\': 1500}\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\'}\n[result] Finished waiting for 1500ms. {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\n[result] {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nExcellent! I can now see the Issues dashboard. I can see several issues with "feature" in their titles. Looking at the "Updated date" column on the right, I need to find the most recently updated issue that has "feature" in its title. \n\nI can see several issues with "[Feature suggestion]" in their titles. The list shows:\n1. "Tm Theme Editor" - updated 2 years ago\n2. "[Feature suggestion] Support linking to an accessibility statement" - updated 2 years ago\n3. "[Feature suggestion] WCAG trash panda mode" - updated 2 years ago\n4. "[Feature suggestion] Add a submission form" - updated 2 years ago\n5. "[Feature suggestion] Color theme slider" - updated 2 years ago\n6. "Outdated dependencies" - updated 2 years ago\n\nAll of these show "updated 2 years ago". I notice the list is sorted by "Updated date" (I can see the dropdown at the top right). However, I need to look more carefully to see which one is the MOST recently updated. Let me check if I need to scroll down to see more issues, or if I can filter/sort differently to find the latest one.\n\nActually, looking more carefully at the current sort, the issues are already sorted by "Updated date" (as shown in the dropdown on the right). The issues at the top of the list should be the most recently updated. But they all show "updated 2 years ago". Let me click on the first feature suggestion issue to check its details.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'target\': \'[Feature suggestion] Support linking to an accessibility statement\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI can see the URL changed to "/byteblaze/a11y-webring.club/-/issues/71", but the page is still showing the issues list. Let me wait for the page to load.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'duration\': 2000}\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\'}\n[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\n[result] {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect! I can now see the issue details. This is issue #71: "[Feature suggestion] Support linking to an accessibility statement". \n\nI can see important information:\n- Status: **Open** (shown by the green "Open" badge at the top)\n- The issue is NOT closed\n\nHowever, I need to verify if this is indeed the LATEST updated issue with "feature" in the title. Let me go back to the issues list to check the other feature issues and compare their update times more carefully. Let me click the back button or navigate back to the issues list.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'target\': \'Issues link in the left sidebar\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI\'m still on the same issue page. Let me click on "List" in the left sidebar to go back to the issues list view.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'target\': \'List link in the left sidebar under Issues\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood! Now I\'m viewing the issues list for the "a11y-webring.club" project specifically. I can see 4 feature suggestion issues:\n\n1. "[Feature suggestion] Support linking to an accessibility statement" #71 - updated 2 years ago\n2. "[Feature suggestion] WCAG trash panda mode" #39 - updated 2 years ago\n3. "[Feature suggestion] Add a submission form" #30 - updated 2 years ago\n4. "[Feature suggestion] Color theme slider" #21 - updated 2 years ago\n\nAll show "updated 2 years ago". However, I need to go back to the dashboard view that shows ALL issues across ALL projects to find the latest updated issue with "feature" in the title. Let me navigate back to the Issues dashboard.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'target\': \'Icon that looks like a checklist with a badge showing "13" in the top right navigation bar\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI\'m still in the project-specific view. I can see the URL shows it\'s still the a11y-webring.club project issues. Let me click on the GitLab logo to go to the dashboard home, and then access the global issues view.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'target\': \'GitLab fox logo in the top left corner\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect! Now I\'m back at the global Issues dashboard showing all issues across all projects. I can see the issues are sorted by "Updated date" (shown in the dropdown on the right). Looking at the list, I can see several issues with "feature" in their titles, and they all show "updated 2 years ago".\n\nHowever, I need to look more carefully at the exact timing. The "Updated date" dropdown is showing the current sort. Let me examine the visible feature suggestion issues more closely. Looking at the top of the list, I can see:\n\n1. "Tm Theme Editor" - updated 2 years ago (no "feature" in title)\n2. "[Feature suggestion] Support linking to an accessibility statement" - updated 2 years ago\n3. "[Feature suggestion] WCAG trash panda mode" - updated 2 years ago\n4. "[Feature suggestion] Add a submission form" - updated 2 years ago\n5. "[Feature suggestion] Color theme slider" - updated 2 years ago\n\nSince they all show "updated 2 years ago", the first feature suggestion in the list (which is sorted by updated date) should be the most recently updated one. That would be "[Feature suggestion] Support linking to an accessibility statement" at issue #71.\n\nI already checked that issue and saw it was **Open** (not closed). Let me verify this is correct by clicking on it again to double-check its status.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'target\': \'[Feature suggestion] Support linking to an accessibility statement\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nIt navigated back to the Projects page. Let me go back to the Issues dashboard by clicking the issues icon again.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'target\': \'Icon that looks like a checklist with a badge showing "13" in the top right navigation bar\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nThe page is still showing the Projects view even though the URL indicates it should be showing issues. Let me wait for the page to load properly.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'duration\': 2000}\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\'}\n[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\n[result] {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood! Now I\'m back at the Issues dashboard. Looking at the list, I can see all the issues with "feature" in their titles show "updated 2 years ago". Since the list is sorted by "Updated date", the first feature suggestion should be the most recently updated.\n\nHowever, I notice that "[Feature suggestion] Support linking to an accessibility statement" is the second item in the list (the first is "Tm Theme Editor" which doesn\'t have "feature" in the title). Let me click on this issue to verify its status.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'target\': \'[Feature suggestion] Support linking to an accessibility statement link text in the issues list\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nThe URL changed to the issue page (issues/71), but the page is still showing the issues list. Let me wait and scroll down or refresh to see if the issue details load.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'duration\': 2000}\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'direction\': \'down\', \'distance\': \'medium\'}\n[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\n[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect! Now I can see the issue details page has loaded. I can see clearly at the top of the page:\n\n- **Status badge: "Open"** (green badge shown at the top)\n- **Title: "[Feature suggestion] Support linking to an accessibility statement"**\n\nThis issue is **NOT closed** - it is **Open**.\n\nHowever, I should verify that this is indeed the MOST RECENTLY updated issue with "feature" in the title. Let me scroll back to the top to see if there\'s more specific date/time information, or I should go back to the issues list and check more carefully for the exact dates.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'direction\': \'up\', \'distance\': \'medium\'}\n[result] Scrolled up by medium distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood! I can clearly see this issue\'s status:\n- **Status: Open** (green badge at the top)\n- **Title: "[Feature suggestion] Support linking to an accessibility statement"**\n- **Issue #71**\n\nThe status shows it is **NOT closed** - it is currently **Open**.\n\nHowever, I need to make absolutely sure this is the LATEST updated issue with "feature" in the title. Let me navigate back to the issues dashboard and check if there are any other feature issues that might have been updated more recently. Let me use the browser\'s back navigation to return to the issues list.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'keys\': [\'alt\', \'arrowLeft\']}\n[result] Keys pressed successfully\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\'}\n[result] {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect! I\'m back at the Issues dashboard. Now I can see the full list sorted by "Updated date". Looking at the issues with "feature" in their titles, I can see:\n\n1. **"[Feature suggestion] Support linking to an accessibility statement"** - updated 2 years ago\n2. **"[Feature suggestion] WCAG trash panda mode"** - updated 2 years ago  \n3. **"[Feature suggestion] Add a submission form"** - updated 2 years ago\n4. **"[Feature suggestion] Color theme slider"** - updated 2 years ago\n\nAll feature suggestions show "updated 2 years ago". Since the list is sorted by "Updated date" in descending order (most recent first), and "[Feature suggestion] Support linking to an accessibility statement" is the first feature issue in the list, it should be the most recently updated.\n\nHowever, I notice all these times say "2 years ago" which is quite vague. Let me click on the "Updated date" dropdown to see if I can get more precise sorting or check if there are more specific timestamps. Actually, I should verify my finding is correct by checking if this is truly the latest. Let me hover over the update time to see if there\'s a tooltip with more specific information.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__hover: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'target\': \'updated 2 years ago text on the right side of the [Feature suggestion] Support linking to an accessibility statement row\'}\n[result] Hover action completed successfully. Moved to "updated 2 years ago text on the right side of the [Feature suggestion] Support linking to an accessibility statement row" at (1202, 363) {\'type\': \'image\'\nThe hover didn\'t show a tooltip. Based on what I can see, the issues list is sorted by "Updated date" and "[Feature suggestion] Support linking to an accessibility statement" is the first feature issue in the list. Since the sort order typically shows most recent first, this appears to be the latest updated feature issue.\n\nI already confirmed that this issue (#71) is **Open** (not closed).\n\nHowever, to be thorough and ensure I have the correct answer, let me check if there are any feature issues on subsequent pages or if I need to scroll down to see if there are any more recent ones. Let me scroll down to check if there are more issues below.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'direction\': \'down\', \'distance\': \'long\'}\n[result] Scrolled down by long distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood, I can see more issues below. I can see all the feature suggestions I saw before, and they all show "updated 2 years ago". There are no other issues with "feature" in their title visible in this portion. Let me continue scrolling to check if there are any more.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'direction\': \'down\', \'distance\': \'long\'}\n[result] Scrolled down by long distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nThe page doesn\'t seem to be scrolling further - I\'m seeing the same content. This appears to be all the issues. Looking at the complete list, the feature suggestion issues I can see are:\n\n1. "[Feature suggestion] Support linking to an accessibility statement" #71 - updated 2 years ago\n2. "[Feature suggestion] WCAG trash panda mode" #39 - updated 2 years ago\n3. "[Feature suggestion] Add a submission form" #30 - updated 2 years ago\n4. "[Feature suggestion] Color theme slider" #21 - updated 2 years ago\n\nSince the list is sorted by "Updated date" in descending order (most recent first), and "[Feature suggestion] Support linking to an accessibility statement" is the first feature issue appearing in the list, it is the latest updated issue with "feature" in the title.\n\nI have already verified that this issue (#71) is **Open** (not closed).\n\nTherefore, the answer to the task "Open my latest updated issue that has keyword \'feature\' in its title to check if it is closed" is:\n\n**The issue is NOT closed - it is Open.**\n[tool] mcp__task-completion__complete_task: {\'finalAnswer\': \'No\'}\n[complete] No\nPerfect! I\'ve completed the task. The latest updated issue with "feature" in its title is "[Feature suggestion] Support linking to an accessibility statement" (issue #71), and it is **NOT closed** - the status shows it is **Open**.'}</pre></div><div class='parsed_action' style='background-color:yellow'><pre>stop [No]</pre></div></div>
