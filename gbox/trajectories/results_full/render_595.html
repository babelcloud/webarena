Good! I can see I'm on the Postmill forum website (a Reddit-like forum). I'm currently logged in as "MarvelsGrantMan136" and I can see there are subscribed forums listed on the right side (cmu_lli, Cyberpunk, Karaoke, PlantsForCatParents, sci_fi). 

However, I don't see "space" in the subscribed forums list, which means I need to find the "space" forum first. The main content area appears to be loading or empty. Let me click on "Forums" to see all available forums.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Forums link in the red navigation bar at the top'}

Perfect! I can see the list of forums now. I can see several forums listed (AskReddit, relationship_advice, worldnews, news, movies, memes, wallstreetbets, gaming) but I don't see "space" on this page yet. I need to scroll down to find the "space" forum.

Good, I've scrolled down and can see more forums (technology, pics, funny, television, mildlyinteresting, Showerthoughts, todayilearned, personalfinance, LifeProTips, Futurology). I still don't see "space" yet. Let me continue scrolling down.

Excellent! I found the "space" forum at the bottom of the page! I can see:

Now I need to click on the "space" forum to enter it and find a trending post.

Perfect! I'm now in the /r/space forum and I can see several posts sorted by "Hot" (which shows trending posts). I can see the posts with their vote counts:

1. "The Moon, Saturn and Jupiter through my 4" telescope and smartphone" - 14304 votes, 77 comments
2. "NASA's Annual Day of Remembrance today, Jan. 26, honors the astronauts who died during the Apollo 1 fire and the Challenger and Columbia space shuttle disasters" - 12645 votes, 108 comments
3. "My two year progress shooting Jupiter, using the same $300 telescope!" - 11231 votes, 114 comments
4. "My progress at Astrophotography" - 10277 votes, 114 comments
5. "Astronaut Peggy Whitson in the Festive Spirit 2016" - 9999 votes, 45 comments

The top trending post is "The Moon, Saturn and Jupiter through my 4" telescope and smartphone" with 14304 votes. Let me click on this post to open its thread.

I see that clicking on the post opened the image directly (showing the Moon, Jupiter, and Saturn in the photo). This is the image URL, not the post thread. I need to go back and access the comments/thread page instead. Let me use the back button.

Excellent! I've successfully opened the thread for the trending post "The Moon, Saturn and Jupiter through my 4" telescope and smartphone". I can see:
- The post with 14304 votes
- The image

- And on the right side, I can see the "space" forum info with a "Subscribe" button

Now I need to click the "Subscribe" button to subscribe to this forum. The button is on the right side of the page.
