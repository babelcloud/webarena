I can see I'm on the Magento Admin Dashboard. To find customer reviews about "Pursuit Tone Band", I need to navigate to the product catalog and find this product, then check its reviews. Let me use the search functionality or navigate to the catalog to find this product.

Let me search for "Pursuit Tone Band" using the search icon at the top of the page.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'search icon magnifying glass in the top right area of the header'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! The search field is now active. Let me type "Pursuit Tone Band" to search for this product.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'content': 'Pursuit Tone Band', 'pressEnterAfterType': True}
[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the search has been entered but it seems like the page hasn't changed. Let me wait a moment for the search results to load.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I can see a dropdown menu with search results showing several options:
- "Pursuit Tone Band" in Products
- "Pursuit Tone Band" in Orders
- "Pursuit Tone Band" in Customers
- "Pursuit Tone Band" in Pages

To find customer reviews and what they don't like about the product, I should click on "Pursuit Tone Band" in Products to go to the product page.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': '"Pursuit Tone Band" in Products link in the dropdown menu'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the page is loading (there's a loading indicator at the top). Let me wait for the page to fully load.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'duration': 3000}
[result] Finished waiting for 3000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I see the search results show "0 records found" and "We couldn't find any records." This suggests the product might not be in the admin catalog with that exact name, or I need to search differently. However, to find customer reviews, I should actually navigate to the storefront (the customer-facing website) rather than the admin panel. Let me check if there's a way to view the storefront or access customer reviews from here.

Let me try clicking on the CATALOG option in the left sidebar to see if I can find the product there.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'CATALOG menu item in the left sidebar'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I can see the Catalog menu has opened, showing "Products" and "Categories" options. To find customer reviews, I need to check if there's a reviews section in the admin. Let me look for "MARKETING" or check the main menu for reviews. Let me close this menu first and look for a reviews section in the sidebar.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'X close button on the Catalog menu'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I see the search is still showing "0 records found" for "Pursuit Tone Band". Let me clear this filter and try a different approach. I should look for the MARKETING section in the sidebar, as product reviews are often found there. Let me click on MARKETING.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'MARKETING menu item in the left sidebar'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I can see the Marketing menu has opened and I can see "All Reviews" and "Pending Reviews" under the "User Content" section. Let me click on "All Reviews" to see customer reviews.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'All Reviews option in the User Content section'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the URL has changed to the reviews page. Let me close the Marketing menu and wait for the page to load completely.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'X close button on the Marketing menu'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Great! I can now see the reviews page with customer reviews. I can see several reviews, but I need to find reviews specifically for "Pursuit Tone Band". Let me close this menu and search for reviews of that product. I can see there's a search/filter functionality. Let me close the Marketing menu first.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'keys': ['escape']}
[result] Keys pressed successfully
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c'}
[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The menu is still open. Let me click outside of it to close it, then I'll search for "Pursuit Tone Band" reviews.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'X close button in top right corner of Marketing menu'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I can see the Reviews page clearly with 351 records found. I need to search for reviews specifically for "Pursuit Tone Band". I can see there's a "Product" column. Let me click on the Product filter field to search for "Pursuit Tone Band".
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Product filter text field in the search filters row'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I see a dropdown has appeared showing "Main Website", "Main Website Store", and "Default Store View". This is a visibility filter, not a product filter. Let me click elsewhere to close this and look for the correct Product filter field. I need to scroll right to see if there's a product name field.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'keys': ['escape']}
[result] Keys pressed successfully
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c'}
[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the Product column in the table. Let me scroll right to see if there's a Product filter field that I can use to search for "Pursuit Tone Band". Let me try scrolling the table to the right to see more filter fields.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'short'}
[result] Scrolled down by short distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I can see more reviews now. I can see various products like "Chloe Compete Tank", "Breathe-Easy Tank", "Bella Tank", "Zoe Tank", "Erika Running Short". I need to continue scrolling to find "Pursuit Tone Band" reviews. Let me scroll down more.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I've reached the end of the page. I can see this is page 1 of 18, showing only 20 reviews per page. Rather than scrolling through all pages, I should use the search/filter functionality. Let me scroll back up to the filter fields and search for "Pursuit Tone Band" specifically.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'long'}
[result] Scrolled up by long distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I can see the filter row now. I can see there are various filter fields but I need to scroll horizontally to see the Product filter field. Let me look more carefully - I can see there's a filter field that appears to be highlighted in blue. Let me try using Ctrl+F to search within the page, or I can scroll the table horizontally to find the Product filter. Let me scroll up a bit more to see the full filter row.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'short'}
[result] Scrolled up by short distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I can see the filter row clearly. I can see there's a Product column header. Let me click on the Product filter input field (the empty text box under the "Product" column header) to search for "Pursuit Tone Band".
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'empty text input field directly below the Product column header'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see a field is now focused (highlighted in blue), but that appears to be under the "ID" column. Let me scroll the filter row horizontally to find the Product filter field. Let me try pressing Tab to move to the next field or try clicking more to the right where the Product column should be.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'keys': ['tab']}
[result] Keys pressed successfully
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c'}
[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the focus has moved to the "From" date field in the Created column. Let me continue tabbing through the fields to reach the Product filter field, or I can try a different approach. Let me try using Ctrl+F to search for "Pursuit" on the page to quickly find if there are any reviews visible.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'keys': ['control', 'f']}
[result] Keys pressed successfully
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c'}
[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! The browser's find dialog has opened at the top right. Now let me type "Pursuit" to search for it on this page.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'content': 'Pursuit'}
[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the search shows "0/0" which means "Pursuit" is not found on the current page. This means there are no reviews for "Pursuit Tone Band" on this page. Let me close the search and try a different approach. I'll need to use the filter fields to search across all pages. Let me close this search.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'keys': ['escape']}
[result] Keys pressed successfully
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c'}
[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! Now let me navigate directly to the Product filter field. I can see the table has columns for Product. Let me scroll the page horizontally to see if I can access the Product filter field better. Let me try clicking directly in the area where the Product filter should be. I'll look for the text input field that's in the filter row under the "Product" column header.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'keys': ['arrowRight']}
[result] Keys pressed successfully
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c'}
[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Let me try clicking directly on the text input field in the filter row that's under the "Product" column. I can see the Product column is visible in the table. Let me click on that specific filter field.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'text input field in the filter row under the Product column header, located to the right of the Type column filter'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I see this opened the Visibility dropdown again. Let me close this and try a different approach. Since the product name might not match exactly in the admin, or the filtering is complex, let me navigate to the storefront website instead where I can find customer reviews more easily. Let me press Escape to close this dropdown first.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'keys': ['escape']}
[result] Keys pressed successfully
Let me navigate to the storefront to find reviews for "Pursuit Tone Band". The admin URL is on port 7780, so the storefront is likely on a different port or the base URL. Let me check the URL bar and navigate to the main storefront. I'll modify the URL to go to the storefront.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'URL address bar at the top of the browser'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! The URL bar is now active. I can see the current URL is on port 7780 (admin). Let me navigate to the storefront by removing the /admin path and using port 7780 or the base port. Let me type the storefront URL.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'content': 'http://ec2-3-149-78-74.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:7780/', 'replace': True, 'pressEnterAfterType': True}
[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}

[result] Finished waiting for 3000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Interesting! I'm now on the "Pending Reviews" page showing 5 records. I can see reviews for products like "Circe Hooded Ice Fleece" and "Olivia 1/4 Zip Light Jacket". I need to find reviews for "Pursuit Tone Band". Let me click on the Product filter field and search for it. I can see there's a Product column with a filter field above the data.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'text input field in the filter row under the Product column header'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I can see the Product filter field is now focused (highlighted in blue). Now let me type "Pursuit Tone Band" to search for reviews of this product.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'content': 'Pursuit Tone Band'}
[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Great! I can see "Pursuit Tone Band" has been typed in the Product filter field. Now I need to click the "Search" button to apply the filter and find reviews for this product.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Search button above the table on the left side'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}

[result] Finished waiting for 3000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! The search results show "0 records found" and "We couldn't find any records." This means there are no pending reviews for "Pursuit Tone Band". Now I need to check ALL reviews (not just pending ones). Let me go back to the "All Reviews" page. Let me click on MARKETING in the sidebar.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'MARKETING menu item in the left sidebar'}

[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the page has loaded and it shows "0 records found" and "We couldn't find any records." The filter still has "Pursuit Tone Band" in the Product field, and it's showing no results even in ALL reviews. 

This means there are NO customer reviews for "Pursuit Tone Band" in the admin system at all. However, the product might exist on the storefront with reviews that customers can see. Let me navigate to the customer-facing storefront to check for reviews there. Let me go to the storefront URL.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'URL address bar at the top of the browser'}

Good! I'm back at the admin dashboard. I can see "Quest Lumaflex™ Band" in the bestsellers list. Since I cannot find reviews for "Pursuit Tone Band" in the admin, and the product name search returned no results, let me try accessing the storefront directly.

- **Title:** "Want more resistance"

- **Review by Keren (4/19/23):** "Agreed. I can do plenty of exercises with it and its awesome for when I can't make it to the gym, but I'd like more resistance, too."

This means there are no reviews for "Pursuit Tone Band" on this page. Let me close the search and try a different approach. I\'ll need to use the filter fields to search across all pages.
