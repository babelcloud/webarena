Perfect! I can see Carnegie Mellon University is now displayed on the map with a red marker. The map shows the CMU campus area in Pittsburgh. Now I need to search for the nearest McDonald's from this location. I can see there are several McDonald's markers (the "M" icons) visible on the map already. Let me look for the "Get Directions" functionality. I'll need to search for McDonald's near CMU. Let me click on the search box again to search for McDonald's.

Now I need to get directions from CMU to this McDonald's. Let me look for a way to get directions. I'll try clicking on "Where is this?" link or look for a directions option. Let me click on the directions icon in the toolbar.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Directions icon with blue arrows next to the Go button in the toolbar'}

- "From" field (with a green marker icon)
- "To" field (with a red marker icon)
- A dropdown showing "Car (OSRM)" for the routing mode
- A "Go" button
- "Reverse Directions" link

Now I need to fill in the "From" field with CMU Pittsburgh and the "To" field should be filled with the McDonald's address. Let me click on the "From" field first.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'From text input field in the directions panel'}

[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'content': "McDonald's 3708 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh", 'pressEnterAfterType': False}
[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I can see that both fields are now filled:

- **To:** McDonald's 3708 Forbes Avenue Pittsburgh

The transportation mode is set to "Car (OSRM)" which is perfect for getting driving directions. Now let me click the "Go" button to get the directions and driving time.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Go button in the directions panel'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
