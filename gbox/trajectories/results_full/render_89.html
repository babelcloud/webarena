Perfect! The search has found Connecticut and the map is now zoomed in to show Connecticut and its surrounding states. I can clearly see Connecticut labeled in the center of the map, and I can see the state borders (shown in red/pink lines).

Looking at the map, I can identify the neighboring states:
- **Massachusetts** - to the north (clearly labeled above Connecticut)
- **Rhode Island** - to the east (labeled to the right of Connecticut)
- **New York** - to the west and south (I can see "New York" labeled to the left and below, including areas like Yonkers)

Let me click on the Connecticut link in the search results to get more detailed information and confirm all the bordering states.

[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! The map has zoomed in even more to show Connecticut in detail. I can now clearly see Connecticut and all its bordering states. Let me take a careful look at the map to identify all the states that share a border with Connecticut.

Looking at the map, I can see:
- Connecticut is in the center
- To the **north**: I can see Massachusetts (with cities like Springfield, Holyoke visible)
- To the **east**: Rhode Island (I can see areas east of Connecticut)
- To the **west**: New York (I can see areas to the west including the Hudson River area)
- To the **south**: Long Island Sound (which is water, part of New York)

Wait, I need to scroll down or look more carefully at the southern border. Let me take another screenshot and examine more closely. I should also look for any information panel that might list the bordering states. Let me wait for the page to fully load first.

Perfect! A sidebar has appeared with information about Connecticut. I can see it shows:
- **Relation: Connecticut (165794)**
- **Version #133**
- Various tags including border_type: state, boundary: administrative

However, I don't see information about bordering states in this panel. Let me scroll down in this sidebar to see if there's more information about neighboring states.

Good! The map has zoomed out a bit and I can now see a clearer view of Connecticut and its surrounding region. I can see:
- Connecticut (in green in the center)
- New York to the west
- Boston to the northeast (which is in Massachusetts)
- The water (Long Island Sound) to the south

Let me continue scrolling in the sidebar to see if there's information about neighboring states, or I should examine the map more carefully to identify all bordering states.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}

Good! The map has zoomed in and I can now see the northeastern states more clearly with state borders (in pink/red lines). I can see "New York" labeled. Let me continue zooming in a few more times to get a clearer view of Connecticut and all its neighboring states. Let me click the zoom in button again.

[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the map is now zoomed in but I can see New York and Philadelphia labeled on the right side. The map seems to be loading. Let me wait a moment for it to fully load, and then I need to pan the map to center on Connecticut. Let me wait for the map to load.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'duration': 2000}

Good! The map has loaded more. I can see various cities labeled including Buffalo, Erie, Rochester, Syracuse, Albany, Springfield, Hartford, Danbury, Bridgeport, New York, Pittsburgh, Harrisburg, Scranton, Allentown. I can see state borders in pink/red lines. However, I need to center the view better on Connecticut. Let me try a different approach - let me search for Connecticut again to get a properly centered view.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'Search text input field at the top left'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the search field is active with "Carnegie Mellon Cafe" showing. Let me clear it and type "Connecticut" again.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'content': 'Connecticut', 'replace': True, 'pressEnterAfterType': True}
[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I have an excellent view of the region. I can clearly see Connecticut labeled on the map, and I can see the state borders (shown in pink/red lines). Let me carefully examine the map to identify all the states that border Connecticut:

Looking at the map, I can see:
- **Vermont** - labeled in the top right area (north of Connecticut)
- **Massachusetts** - labeled in the right side (northeast of Connecticut, with Boston and Springfield visible)
- **New York** - labeled multiple times on the left side (west of Connecticut)
- **Connecticut** - labeled in the center
- **Rhode Island** - I need to look more carefully, it should be to the east of Connecticut

I can also see:
- New Jersey to the south/southwest
- Lake Ontario and Rochester to the northwest

Let me close the search results panel to get a clearer view and verify Rhode Island.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'X button on the Search Results panel'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! Now I have a very clear and detailed view of Connecticut and all the surrounding states. Let me carefully examine the borders of Connecticut by looking at the state boundary lines (shown in red/pink):

Looking at Connecticut (which I can see cities like Hartford, New Haven, Bridgeport, New Britain, Waterbury, Meriden, Torrington):

**To the NORTH**: I can see the border goes up to Massachusetts (I can see Springfield, Holyoke, Chicopee to the north)

**To the EAST**: Following the eastern border, I can see it borders Rhode Island (I can see Providence area to the east, and cities like Woonsocket, East Providence on the other side of the border)

**To the WEST**: The western border clearly borders New York (I can see cities on the New York side like Poughkeepsie, Newburgh, Yonkers, White Plains)

**To the SOUTH**: The southern border is Long Island Sound (water), which separates Connecticut from Long Island, New York

So Connecticut borders **THREE states**:
1. **Massachusetts** (to the north)
2. **Rhode Island** (to the east)  
3. **New York** (to the west and southwest)

Now let me complete the task with the final answer.
[tool] mcp__task-completion__complete_task: {'finalAnswer': 'Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and New York'}
[complete] Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and New York
Perfect! I have successfully identified the three US states that border Connecticut:

1. **Massachusetts** - to the north
2. **Rhode Island** - to the east  
3. **New York** - to the west

The task is complete.</pre></div><div class='action_object' style='background-color:grey'><pre>{'action_type': <ActionTypes.STOP: 17>, 'coords': array([0., 0.], dtype=float32), 'element_role': 0, 'element_name': '', 'text': [], 'page_number': 0, 'url': '', 'nth': 0, 'pw_code': '', 'element_id': '', 'key_comb': '', 'direction': '', 'answer': 'Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and New York', 'raw_prediction': 'I\'ll help you find which US states border Connecticut.

Let me close the sidebar first.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c\', \'target\': \'X button in the top right corner of the Relation: Connecticut sidebar\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood, the sidebar is closed. Now I can see the map with "New York" label visible in the northeastern area. Let me use the zoom in button on the right side of the map to zoom in closer to Connecticut.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c\', \'target\': \'Plus sign zoom in button on the right side of the map\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood! The map has zoomed in and I can now see the northeastern states more clearly with state borders (in pink/red lines). I can see "New York" labeled. Let me continue zooming in a few more times to get a clearer view of Connecticut and all its neighboring states. Let me click the zoom in button again.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c\', \'target\': \'Plus sign zoom in button on the right side of the map\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI can see the map is now zoomed in but I can see New York and Philadelphia labeled on the right side. The map seems to be loading. Let me wait a moment for it to fully load, and then I need to pan the map to center on Connecticut. Let me wait for the map to load.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {\'boxId\': \'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c\', \'duration\': 2000}\n[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood! The map has loaded more. I can see various cities labeled including Buffalo, Erie, Rochester, Syracuse, Albany, Springfield, Hartford, Danbury, Bridgeport, New York, Pittsburgh, Harrisburg, Scranton, Allentown. I can see state borders in pink/red lines. However, I need to center the view better on Connecticut. Let me try a different approach - let me search for Connecticut again to get a properly centered view.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c\', \'target\': \'Search text input field at the top left\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI can see the search field is active with "Carnegie Mellon Cafe" showing. Let me clear it and type "Connecticut" again.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {\'boxId\': \'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c\', \'content\': \'Connecticut\', \'replace\': True, \'pressEnterAfterType\': True}\n[result] Text typed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect! Now I have an excellent view of the region. I can clearly see Connecticut labeled on the map, and I can see the state borders (shown in pink/red lines). Let me carefully examine the map to identify all the states that border Connecticut:\n\nLooking at the map, I can see:\n- **Vermont** - labeled in the top right area (north of Connecticut)\n- **Massachusetts** - labeled in the right side (northeast of Connecticut, with Boston and Springfield visible)\n- **New York** - labeled multiple times on the left side (west of Connecticut)\n- **Connecticut** - labeled in the center\n- **Rhode Island** - I need to look more carefully, it should be to the east of Connecticut\n\nI can also see:\n- New Jersey to the south/southwest\n- Lake Ontario and Rochester to the northwest\n\nLet me close the search results panel to get a clearer view and verify Rhode Island.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c\', \'target\': \'X button on the Search Results panel\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nExcellent! Now I have a very clear and detailed view of Connecticut and all the surrounding states. Let me carefully examine the borders of Connecticut by looking at the state boundary lines (shown in red/pink):\n\nLooking at Connecticut (which I can see cities like Hartford, New Haven, Bridgeport, New Britain, Waterbury, Meriden, Torrington):\n\n**To the NORTH**: I can see the border goes up to Massachusetts (I can see Springfield, Holyoke, Chicopee to the north)\n\n**To the EAST**: Following the eastern border, I can see it borders Rhode Island (I can see Providence area to the east, and cities like Woonsocket, East Providence on the other side of the border)\n\n**To the WEST**: The western border clearly borders New York (I can see cities on the New York side like Poughkeepsie, Newburgh, Yonkers, White Plains)\n\n**To the SOUTH**: The southern border is Long Island Sound (water), which separates Connecticut from Long Island, New York\n\nSo Connecticut borders **THREE states**:\n1. **Massachusetts** (to the north)\n2. **Rhode Island** (to the east)  \n3. **New York** (to the west and southwest)\n\nNow let me complete the task with the final answer.\n[tool] mcp__task-completion__complete_task: {\'finalAnswer\': \'Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and New York\'}\n[complete] Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and New York\nPerfect! I have successfully identified the three US states that border Connecticut:\n\n1. **Massachusetts** - to the north\n2. **Rhode Island** - to the east  \n3. **New York** - to the west\n\nThe task is complete.'}</pre></div><div class='parsed_action' style='background-color:yellow'><pre>stop [Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and New York]</pre></div></div>
