Good! I can see I'm in the Magento Admin Dashboard. I need to find products that have exactly 10 units left in stock. To do this, I should navigate to the Catalog section to view products and their inventory levels. Let me click on the CATALOG menu option on the left sidebar.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'CATALOG menu item in the left sidebar with shopping bag icon'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! The Catalog menu has expanded showing "Products" and "Categories" options. Let me click on "Products" to view all products and their inventory.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'Products menu item in the Catalog submenu'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the page is loading (note the loading indicator in the browser tab). Let me wait a moment for the products page to fully load.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'duration': 3000}
[result] Finished waiting for 3000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! I can see the Products page has loaded. I can see there's a search active for "Zoe Tank" and there are 16 records found. I can see a "Quantity" column in the table, but the current view shows "Salable Quantity" with "Default Stock" values (100, 99, etc.). 

However, I need to see the actual inventory quantity that shows which products have exactly 10 units left. Let me clear the search filter first to see all products, and then I'll need to check if there's a way to filter or view products by their inventory quantity.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'Clear all link in the top right area'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! The filter has been cleared and I can see all products now (still showing 16 records found). I can see the "Quantity" column shows values like "0.0000", "100.0000", etc. 

I notice that the "Quantity" column in the current view shows decimal values, but I need to find products with exactly 10 units. Let me use the Filters button to add a filter for quantity = 10. Let me click on the "Filters" button.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'Filters button with funnel icon near the top right'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! The filters panel has opened. I can see there's a "Quantity" filter with "from" and "to" fields. I need to filter for products with quantity equal to 10. Let me enter 10 in both the "from" and "to" fields for Quantity to find products with exactly 10 units.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'Quantity from input field'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good, the Quantity "from" field is now focused (I can see the blue border). Let me type 10 in this field.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'content': '10', 'pressEnterAfterType': False}
[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I've entered "10" in the Quantity "from" field. Now I need to click on the "to" field and enter 10 there as well to filter for products with exactly 10 units.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'Quantity to input field'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the "from" field still shows "10" and I need to click on the "to" field below it. Let me click on the correct "to" field for Quantity.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'Empty input field directly below the Quantity from field that contains 10'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now the Quantity "to" field is focused (shown by the blue border). Let me type 10 in this field.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'content': '10', 'pressEnterAfterType': False}
[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! I've set the Quantity filter to be from 10 to 10, which will show products with exactly 10 units. Now let me click the "Apply Filters" button to apply this filter.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'Apply Filters button in the bottom right of the filter panel'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the filter has been applied successfully! The page now shows "Active filters: Quantity: 10 - 10" at the top, and it says "2040 records found". However, I notice that the Quantity column is showing "0.0000" for all the visible products, which doesn't match the filter I applied.

This seems odd - the filter is active but the products shown have 0 quantity. Let me scroll down to see if there are products with quantity 10 below, or perhaps the column I'm looking at is the wrong one. Let me scroll down to see more products.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Interesting! Now the page shows "0 records found" and "We couldn't find any records." This means there are NO products with exactly 10 units in the regular "Quantity" column.

However, I noticed earlier there was a "Salable Quantity" column showing values like "Default Stock: 100", "Default Stock: 99", etc. Perhaps I need to check if products have 10 units in their salable/available stock rather than the base quantity. 

Let me clear this filter and try a different approach. Maybe I need to look at the inventory details more carefully, or perhaps check individual product pages. Let me click "Clear all" to remove the filter.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'Clear all link in the top right'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I see the Columns menu has opened. Let me close this by clicking elsewhere and then clear the filter. Let me click the Cancel button at the bottom of the columns menu.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'Cancel button at the bottom right of the columns dropdown menu'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good, the columns menu is closed. Now let me click on "Clear all" to remove the quantity filter so I can see all products again.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'Clear all link in the top right corner'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The Columns menu opened again. Let me close this by pressing Escape key, and then I'll try a different approach.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'keys': ['escape']}
[result] Keys pressed successfully
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608'}
[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The Columns menu is still open. Let me click outside this menu area to close it, then I'll remove the quantity filter by clicking the X icon next to the active filter.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'X icon next to Quantity: 10 - 10 in the Active filters area'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I see the filter has been cleared (no more "Active filters" shown), but it still shows "0 records found" and "We couldn't find any records." The page seems to be stuck. Let me scroll up to see if there's an issue, or I should try reloading the page by clicking on the Products menu again.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'long'}
[result] Scrolled up by long distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! The page has reloaded and now shows "2040 records found" with products visible. I can see the products list with the Quantity column showing "0.0000" for all visible products. 

I notice the "Quantity" column shows the basic inventory quantity (all showing 0.0000 here). I need to find products that have 10 units. Since the quantity filter for 10-10 returned 0 results, maybe I should look at the inventory in a different way. Let me check if I need to navigate to a Reports section or use the Inventory menu instead. Let me click on the sidebar to access other menu options. First, let me look for a Reports or Inventory menu item.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'REPORTS menu item in the left sidebar with bar chart icon'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I notice the click didn't seem to navigate away. Let me try a different approach. Since I saw earlier that products show "Salable Quantity" with values like "Default Stock: 100", "Default Stock: 99", maybe I need to look at the salable quantity column more carefully. Let me click on the "Salable Quantity" column header to sort by that column, which might help me find products with 10 units more easily.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'Salable Quantity column header in the product table'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I notice the "Salable Quantity" column is not showing any values in this view. Let me scroll right to see if the Salable Quantity column has data that's not visible in the current view.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'keys': ['arrowRight']}
[result] Keys pressed successfully
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608'}
[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the "Salable Quantity" column is still visible but empty. Let me try a different approach. Perhaps I need to look at individual products by clicking "Edit" on one of them to see the detailed inventory information, or check if there's a way to export/view detailed inventory data. But first, let me check if there's a way to filter using the Filters button with a different approach - perhaps filtering by Salable Quantity instead of regular Quantity. Let me also check the left sidebar menu to see if there's an inventory-specific section.

Let me scroll left in the sidebar to check for more menu options.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled up by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Let me try clicking on one of the products to see its detailed inventory information. I'll click "Edit" for the first product to see if I can view quantity details there.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'Edit link for Arcadio Gym Short product in the first row'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The page doesn't seem to have changed. Let me wait a moment for it to load.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The page hasn't navigated to the product detail page. Let me try a different approach. Since I noticed earlier that when the filter panel was open, I saw products had "Salable Quantity" values like "Default Stock: 100", "Default Stock: 99", etc., let me go back and look more carefully at those values. Let me scroll through the products to manually look for products with quantity 10. But first, let me try clicking directly on a product name instead of the Edit link.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'Arcadio Gym Short product name link in the Name column'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I see a loading indicator in the tab. Let me wait for the page to load.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'duration': 3000}
[result] Finished waiting for 3000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! The product detail page has loaded for "Arcadio Gym Short" (SKU: MSH11). I can see there's a "Quantity" field and importantly, an "Advanced Inventory" link. This is likely where I can see the detailed inventory information. Let me click on "Advanced Inventory" to see the actual quantity available.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'Advanced Inventory link in blue text'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! The Advanced Inventory modal has opened. I can see the "Qty" field (quantity) which appears to be empty. This modal shows inventory management settings, but I need to see the actual quantity value. Looking at the "Qty" field, it appears to be blank or using config settings. This product might be a configurable product with variants, so the inventory might be tracked at the variant level.

Let me close this modal and go back to the product list. I think I need to look at simple products rather than configurable products. Let me click the X button to close this modal.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'X close button in the top right of the Advanced Inventory modal'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good, I'm back on the product page. Let me go back to the products list and try a different approach. Since configurable products don't show quantity at the parent level, I need to look at simple products or find a report that shows all inventory quantities. Let me click the "Back" button to return to the products list.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'Back button in the top right area'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The page is loading. Let me wait for it to navigate back to the products list.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I'm back on the products list. I can see different products now and they all show "0.0000" in the Quantity column and the "Salable Quantity" column is empty. All of these are "Configurable Products". 

I need to find simple products that have actual inventory quantities. Let me use the Filters to filter for "Simple Product" type only, which should show products with actual inventory quantities.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'Filters button near the top right'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! The Filters panel has opened. I can see there's a "Type" dropdown on the right side. Let me click on it to select "Simple Product" to filter for simple products only.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'Type dropdown field in the filters panel on the right side'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! The Type dropdown has opened and I can see the options:
- Simple Product
- Virtual Product
- Bundle Product
- Downloadable Product
- Configurable Product
- Grouped Product

Let me click on "Simple Product" to filter for simple products only.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'Simple Product option in the Type dropdown menu'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! "Simple Product" has been selected in the Type filter. Now I need to also add the Quantity filter for 10. Let me enter 10 in both the Quantity "from" and "to" fields.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'Quantity from input field in the filter panel'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good, the Quantity "from" field is focused. Let me type 10.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'content': '10', 'pressEnterAfterType': False}
[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! Now I need to enter 10 in the Quantity "to" field as well. Let me click on that field.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'Quantity to input field below the from field'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I see the field still shows "10" in the "from" field. Let me click on the "to" field which is the empty one below it.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'empty input field directly under the Quantity from field with value 10'}

Interesting! The filter has partially been applied - I can see the page is now showing "Simple Product" types in the results! I can see products like:
- Ryker LumaTech™ Tee (V-neck)-L-Black - SKU: MS02-L-Black - Quantity: 100.0000 - Default Stock: 100
- Ryker LumaTech™ Tee (V-neck)-XL-Blue - SKU: MS02-XL-Blue - Quantity: 100.0000 - Default Stock: 99

Now I need to add 10 to the "to" field. Let me type 10 in the "to" field which should be focused or let me click on it first.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'content': '10', 'pressEnterAfterType': False}
[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I see the "from" field now shows "1010" - it appended to the existing value. Let me clear this and fix it. Let me click on the "from" field, clear it, and re-enter 10.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'Quantity from field showing 1010'}

Let me select all and replace with 10.

[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! Now the "from" field shows "10". Now let me click on the "to" field and enter 10 there as well.

I clicked on the Price "from" field instead. Let me scroll down in the filter panel to see the Quantity "to" field better, or let me use Tab to navigate to it.

Perfect! I'm now in the Quantity "to" field (I can see it's focused with the blue border). Let me type 10.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'content': '10', 'pressEnterAfterType': False}

Excellent! Now I have both fields set:
- Quantity from: 10
- Quantity to: 10
- Type: Simple Product

Now let me click the "Apply Filters" button to apply these filters and find products with exactly 10 units.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'Apply Filters button in the bottom right of the filter panel'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The filter panel is still open. Let me scroll down to see the Apply Filters button or wait for the page to update. Let me try scrolling down in the filter panel.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'short'}
[result] Scrolled down by short distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! The filters have been applied! I can see:
- Active filters: "Type: Simple Product" and "Quantity: 10 - 10"
- Result: "0 records found"
- Message: "We couldn't find any records."

This means there are NO simple products with exactly 10 units in stock. The task asked for products with 10 units left, and the result is that there are no such products.

Let me verify this is correct by checking if there might be any products with quantity 10 at all. Since filtering for simple products with quantity 10 returned 0 results, there are no products with exactly 10 units in the inventory.
[tool] mcp__task-completion__complete_task: {'finalAnswer': 'N/A'}
[complete] N/A
The task is complete. After filtering the product catalog for items with exactly 10 units in stock, the system returned 0 records. This means there are no products (neither simple products nor any other type) that currently have exactly 10 units remaining in inventory.</pre></div><div class='action_object' style='background-color:grey'><pre>{'action_type': <ActionTypes.STOP: 17>, 'coords': array([0., 0.], dtype=float32), 'element_role': 0, 'element_name': '', 'text': [], 'page_number': 0, 'url': '', 'nth': 0, 'pw_code': '', 'element_id': '', 'key_comb': '', 'direction': '', 'answer': 'N/A', 'raw_prediction': 'I\'ll help you find the SKU of products that have 10 units left.

Let me click on "Advanced Inventory" to see the actual quantity available.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'target\': \'Advanced Inventory link in blue text\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nExcellent! The Advanced Inventory modal has opened. I can see the "Qty" field (quantity) which appears to be empty. This modal shows inventory management settings, but I need to see the actual quantity value. Looking at the "Qty" field, it appears to be blank or using config settings. This product might be a configurable product with variants, so the inventory might be tracked at the variant level.\n\nLet me close this modal and go back to the product list. I think I need to look at simple products rather than configurable products. Let me click the X button to close this modal.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'target\': \'X close button in the top right of the Advanced Inventory modal\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood, I\'m back on the product page. Let me go back to the products list and try a different approach. Since configurable products don\'t show quantity at the parent level, I need to look at simple products or find a report that shows all inventory quantities. Let me click the "Back" button to return to the products list.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'target\': \'Back button in the top right area\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nThe page is loading. Let me wait for it to navigate back to the products list.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'duration\': 2000}\n[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood! I\'m back on the products list. I can see different products now and they all show "0.0000" in the Quantity column and the "Salable Quantity" column is empty. All of these are "Configurable Products". \n\nI need to find simple products that have actual inventory quantities. Let me use the Filters to filter for "Simple Product" type only, which should show products with actual inventory quantities.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'target\': \'Filters button near the top right\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect! The Filters panel has opened. I can see there\'s a "Type" dropdown on the right side. Let me click on it to select "Simple Product" to filter for simple products only.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'target\': \'Type dropdown field in the filters panel on the right side\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nExcellent! The Type dropdown has opened and I can see the options:\n- Simple Product\n- Virtual Product\n- Bundle Product\n- Downloadable Product\n- Configurable Product\n- Grouped Product\n\nLet me click on "Simple Product" to filter for simple products only.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'target\': \'Simple Product option in the Type dropdown menu\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect! "Simple Product" has been selected in the Type filter. Now I need to also add the Quantity filter for 10. Let me enter 10 in both the Quantity "from" and "to" fields.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'target\': \'Quantity from input field in the filter panel\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood, the Quantity "from" field is focused. Let me type 10.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'content\': \'10\', \'pressEnterAfterType\': False}\n[result] Text typed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood! Now I need to enter 10 in the Quantity "to" field as well. Let me click on that field.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'target\': \'Quantity to input field below the from field\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI see the field still shows "10" in the "from" field. Let me click on the "to" field which is the empty one below it.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'target\': \'empty input field directly under the Quantity from field with value 10\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nInteresting! The filter has partially been applied - I can see the page is now showing "Simple Product" types in the results! I can see products like:\n- Ryker LumaTech™ Tee (V-neck)-L-Black - SKU: MS02-L-Black - Quantity: 100.0000 - Default Stock: 100\n- Ryker LumaTech™ Tee (V-neck)-XL-Blue - SKU: MS02-XL-Blue - Quantity: 100.0000 - Default Stock: 99\n\nNow I need to add 10 to the "to" field. Let me type 10 in the "to" field which should be focused or let me click on it first.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'content\': \'10\', \'pressEnterAfterType\': False}\n[result] Text typed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI see the "from" field now shows "1010" - it appended to the existing value. Let me clear this and fix it. Let me click on the "from" field, clear it, and re-enter 10.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'target\': \'Quantity from field showing 1010\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nLet me select all and replace with 10.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'keys\': [\'control\', \'a\']}\n[result] Keys pressed successfully\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'content\': \'10\', \'pressEnterAfterType\': False}\n[result] Text typed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood! Now the "from" field shows "10". Now let me click on the "to" field and enter 10 there as well.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'target\': \'Quantity to input field which is empty, directly below the from field\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI clicked on the Price "from" field instead. Let me scroll down in the filter panel to see the Quantity "to" field better, or let me use Tab to navigate to it.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'keys\': [\'tab\']}\n[result] Keys pressed successfully\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\'}\n[result] {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI\'m now in the Price "to" field. Let me press Tab a few more times to get to the Quantity "to" field.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'keys\': [\'tab\']}\n[result] Keys pressed successfully\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'keys\': [\'tab\']}\n[result] Keys pressed successfully\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\'}\n[result] {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect! I\'m now in the Quantity "to" field (I can see it\'s focused with the blue border). Let me type 10.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'content\': \'10\', \'pressEnterAfterType\': False}\n[result] Text typed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nExcellent! Now I have both fields set:\n- Quantity from: 10\n- Quantity to: 10\n- Type: Simple Product\n\nNow let me click the "Apply Filters" button to apply these filters and find products with exactly 10 units.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'target\': \'Apply Filters button in the bottom right of the filter panel\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nThe filter panel is still open. Let me scroll down to see the Apply Filters button or wait for the page to update. Let me try scrolling down in the filter panel.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'direction\': \'down\', \'distance\': \'short\'}\n[result] Scrolled down by short distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect! The filters have been applied! I can see:\n- Active filters: "Type: Simple Product" and "Quantity: 10 - 10"\n- Result: "0 records found"\n- Message: "We couldn\'t find any records."\n\nThis means there are NO simple products with exactly 10 units in stock. The task asked for products with 10 units left, and the result is that there are no such products.\n\nLet me verify this is correct by checking if there might be any products with quantity 10 at all. Since filtering for simple products with quantity 10 returned 0 results, there are no products with exactly 10 units in the inventory.\n[tool] mcp__task-completion__complete_task: {\'finalAnswer\': \'N/A\'}\n[complete] N/A\nThe task is complete. After filtering the product catalog for items with exactly 10 units in stock, the system returned 0 records. This means there are no products (neither simple products nor any other type) that currently have exactly 10 units remaining in inventory.'}</pre></div><div class='parsed_action' style='background-color:yellow'><pre>stop [N/A]</pre></div></div>
