Good! I can see OpenStreetMap is already open. I need to find the driving time between Niagara Falls and Yale University. Let me close the welcome dialog and search for directions.

First, I need to understand where these locations are:
- Niagara Falls is a city (can be in New York or Ontario)
- Yale University is located in New Haven, Connecticut

Let me close the welcome dialog and use the search function to get directions.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'X button to close the Welcome to OpenStreetMap dialog'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! The dialog is closed. Now I need to get directions between Niagara Falls and Yale University (New Haven, CT). I can see there's a "Directions" icon (the arrow icon) in the sidebar on the right. Let me click on it to get directions.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Directions button with arrow icon in the right sidebar'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I clicked the wrong button - that opened the Share menu instead of directions. Let me close this and look for the directions feature. I'll close this panel first.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'X button to close the Share panel in the top right corner'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! The panel is closed. Now I need to find the directions feature. I can see there's a "Where is this?" link next to the search field. Let me look for a directions button. I'll click on the icon that looks like it might be for directions - the navigation arrow icon in the right sidebar.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Navigation compass icon button in the right sidebar'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
That's showing a tooltip "Zoom in to query features" which isn't what I need. Let me try a different approach. I'll search for Niagara Falls first in the search box, and then look for how to get directions from there. Let me click on the search field.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Search text input field at the top left'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good, the search field is focused. Now I need to search for directions from Niagara Falls to New Haven, CT (where Yale University is located). Let me type a search query that will help me find directions.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'content': 'Niagara Falls to New Haven CT', 'pressEnterAfterType': True}
[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! The search is running and showing "Search Results" with results from "OpenStreetMap Nominatim". Let me wait for the results to load completely.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I see "No results found" for that search query. OpenStreetMap's search doesn't understand directions queries in that format. Let me try a different approach. I need to search for each location separately and then find a way to get directions, or I might need to look for a directions feature. Let me close this search result and try searching for just "Niagara Falls" first.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'X button to close the Search Results panel'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good. Now let me try a different approach. OpenStreetMap may not have a built-in routing feature, or I need to find it. Let me look at the URL pattern - maybe I can construct a URL for directions manually. But first, let me check if there's a routing service. I'll look for routing options by checking the available features. Let me search for "Niagara Falls, NY" first to locate it.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Search text input field'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Now let me clear the search field and search for "Niagara Falls, NY":
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'keys': ['control', 'a']}

[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The search is loading. Let me wait for results:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I found Niagara Falls, NY. I can see the city result and the map has zoomed to Niagara Falls. Now I need to find a way to get directions from here to New Haven, CT (where Yale University is). Let me click on the city result to select it, and then see if there's a way to get directions.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'City of Niagara Falls, Niagara County, New York, United States link in the search results'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I've selected Niagara Falls and can see information about it. Now I need to find a way to get directions. I notice there's a "Where is this?" button visible at the top. Let me look for a directions feature. I'll check if right-clicking on the map or if there's a directions button. Actually, let me try looking at the top menu - I see there's a button with an icon that might be for directions. Let me close this panel first and look for a directions/routing feature.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'X button to close the Relation: City of Niagara Falls panel'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good. Now I need to find a routing/directions feature. Let me look at the icon next to the search button - that icon with an arrow. Let me click on it to see if it's for directions:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Blue arrow icon button next to the Go button in the search area'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! I found the directions feature! The URL changed to `/directions` and I can see a directions panel with:
- "From" field
- "To" field
- "Car (OSRM)" dropdown for route type
- "Go" button
- "Reverse Directions" link

Now I need to enter the two locations. Let me enter "Niagara Falls, NY" in the From field:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'From text input field'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good, the From field is now focused. Let me type "Niagara Falls, NY":
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'content': 'Niagara Falls, NY', 'pressEnterAfterType': False}
[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! "Niagara Falls, NY" has been entered in the From field. Now I need to click on the "To" field and enter "New Haven, CT" (where Yale University is located):
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'To text input field'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Great! I can see that the "From" field has been resolved to "City of Niagara Falls, Niagara County, New..." and there's now a green marker on the map at Niagara Falls. The "To" field is now focused. Let me type "New Haven, CT":
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'content': 'New Haven, CT', 'pressEnterAfterType': False}
[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I've entered "New Haven, CT" in the To field. I can see:
- From: City of Niagara Falls, Niagara County, New...
- To: New Haven, CT
- Car (OSRM) is selected as the routing engine

Now I need to click the "Go" button to get the directions and see the estimated driving time:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Go button'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Great! The routing is being calculated. I can see a loading spinner and the URL has been updated with routing parameters. The "To" field now shows "New Haven, Connecticut, 06518, United Sta..." which confirms it found New Haven, CT. Let me wait for the route to finish calculating:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'duration': 3000}
[result] Finished waiting for 3000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! The route has been calculated and I can see the driving directions! At the top of the Directions panel, I can clearly see:

**"Distance: 680km. Time: 8:44."**

This shows:
- Distance: 680km
- Time: 8:44 (which means 8 hours and 44 minutes)

The map also shows the blue route from Niagara Falls (green marker in the upper left near Lake Ontario) to New Haven, CT (red marker on the right side of the map).

The estimated driving time between the city of Niagara Falls and the city of Yale University (New Haven, CT) is **8:44** (8 hours and 44 minutes).
[tool] mcp__task-completion__complete_task: {'finalAnswer': '8:44'}
[complete] 8:44
The task is complete! I successfully found the estimated driving time between Niagara Falls and Yale University (located in New Haven, CT) using OpenStreetMap's routing feature. The answer is **8 hours and 44 minutes** (8:44).</pre></div><div class='action_object' style='background-color:grey'><pre>{'action_type': <ActionTypes.STOP: 17>, 'coords': array([0., 0.], dtype=float32), 'element_role': 0, 'element_name': '', 'text': [], 'page_number': 0, 'url': '', 'nth': 0, 'pw_code': '', 'element_id': '', 'key_comb': '', 'direction': '', 'answer': '8:44', 'raw_prediction': 'I\'ll help you find the estimated driving time between Niagara Falls and Yale University.

Let me close this panel first and look for a directions/routing feature.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'target\': \'X button to close the Relation: City of Niagara Falls panel\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood. Now I need to find a routing/directions feature. Let me look at the icon next to the search button - that icon with an arrow. Let me click on it to see if it\'s for directions:\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'target\': \'Blue arrow icon button next to the Go button in the search area\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nExcellent! I found the directions feature! The URL changed to `/directions` and I can see a directions panel with:\n- "From" field\n- "To" field\n- "Car (OSRM)" dropdown for route type\n- "Go" button\n- "Reverse Directions" link\n\nNow I need to enter the two locations. Let me enter "Niagara Falls, NY" in the From field:\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'target\': \'From text input field\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood, the From field is now focused. Let me type "Niagara Falls, NY":\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'content\': \'Niagara Falls, NY\', \'pressEnterAfterType\': False}\n[result] Text typed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect! "Niagara Falls, NY" has been entered in the From field. Now I need to click on the "To" field and enter "New Haven, CT" (where Yale University is located):\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'target\': \'To text input field\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGreat! I can see that the "From" field has been resolved to "City of Niagara Falls, Niagara County, New..." and there\'s now a green marker on the map at Niagara Falls. The "To" field is now focused. Let me type "New Haven, CT":\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'content\': \'New Haven, CT\', \'pressEnterAfterType\': False}\n[result] Text typed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect! I\'ve entered "New Haven, CT" in the To field. I can see:\n- From: City of Niagara Falls, Niagara County, New...\n- To: New Haven, CT\n- Car (OSRM) is selected as the routing engine\n\nNow I need to click the "Go" button to get the directions and see the estimated driving time:\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'target\': \'Go button\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGreat! The routing is being calculated. I can see a loading spinner and the URL has been updated with routing parameters. The "To" field now shows "New Haven, Connecticut, 06518, United Sta..." which confirms it found New Haven, CT. Let me wait for the route to finish calculating:\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'duration\': 3000}\n[result] Finished waiting for 3000ms. {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect! The route has been calculated and I can see the driving directions! At the top of the Directions panel, I can clearly see:\n\n**"Distance: 680km. Time: 8:44."**\n\nThis shows:\n- Distance: 680km\n- Time: 8:44 (which means 8 hours and 44 minutes)\n\nThe map also shows the blue route from Niagara Falls (green marker in the upper left near Lake Ontario) to New Haven, CT (red marker on the right side of the map).\n\nThe estimated driving time between the city of Niagara Falls and the city of Yale University (New Haven, CT) is **8:44** (8 hours and 44 minutes).\n[tool] mcp__task-completion__complete_task: {\'finalAnswer\': \'8:44\'}\n[complete] 8:44\nThe task is complete! I successfully found the estimated driving time between Niagara Falls and Yale University (located in New Haven, CT) using OpenStreetMap\'s routing feature. The answer is **8 hours and 44 minutes** (8:44).'}</pre></div><div class='parsed_action' style='background-color:yellow'><pre>stop [8:44]</pre></div></div>
