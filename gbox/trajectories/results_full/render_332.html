I can see that I'm currently on the One Stop Market homepage. I'm already logged in (I can see "Welcome to One Stop Market" and "My Account" in the top right). To find spending information from January to March 2023, I need to access my account and order history.

Let me click on "My Account" to access the account details.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'My Account link in the top right header'}

I can see the page is loading (there's a loading indicator at the top). Let me wait for it to load completely, then take another screenshot.

Perfect! I'm now on the My Account page. I can see there's a "Recent Orders" section showing two orders (5/17/23 and 5/2/23), but I need to see all orders from January to March 2023. Let me click on "My Orders" in the left sidebar to see the complete order history.

Great! I can see the My Orders page. I can see orders from various dates, and I notice there are orders from:
- 3/11/23: $65.32
- 3/10/23: $17.99
- 2/27/23: $762.18
- 2/24/23: $231.54
- 2/11/23: $174.99
- 2/9/23: $185.32

The page shows "Items 1 to 10 of 37 total", so there are more orders. I need to check all pages to find all orders from January to March 2023. However, I also need to filter these to only include orders specifically from "One Stop Market" and verify which orders are actually from the shopping category. Let me scroll down to see if there are more orders visible, and then I'll need to check individual orders to see their details.

Let me first check if there are January orders by going to the next pages. Let me scroll down to see the pagination controls better.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I can now see the pagination better. I can see there are 37 total orders and pages 1, 2, 3, 4. I need to check all pages to find all orders from January, February, and March 2023. Let me click on page 2 to see more orders.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'page number 2 link in pagination'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I see the page is loading. Let me wait for it to load completely.

Excellent! Now I'm on page 2 and I can see orders from January 2023:
- 1/29/23: $440.64
- 1/16/23: $132.24

And orders from late 2022. Let me continue checking the other pages. Let me go back to page 1 to get the complete list. I'll scroll up first to see the beginning of page 2.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled up by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good. Now let me navigate back to page 1 to review all the orders from January to March 2023. However, I realize I need to check each individual order to verify they are from "One Stop Market" and to see what items were purchased (since the task asks specifically about shopping at One Stop Market). Let me click on page 1 first.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'page number 1 link in pagination'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I notice I'm still on page 2. Let me wait for the page to load completely and then try scrolling to see if page 1 loads.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'duration': 2000}

[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I'm back on page 1. I can see the orders from January to March 2023. Let me compile the list and check if I need to view individual orders. Since the website is "One Stop Market" and I'm logged into this account, all these orders should be from One Stop Market. However, I need to verify the exact amounts and ensure I'm counting only the orders from Jan-March 2023.

From page 1, I can see:
- 3/11/23: $65.32 (Complete)
- 3/10/23: $17.99 (Complete)
- 2/27/23: $762.18 (Complete)
- 2/24/23: $231.54 (Canceled)
- 2/11/23: $174.99 (Canceled)
- 2/9/23: $185.32 (Complete)

From page 2, I saw:
- 1/29/23: $440.64 (Complete)
- 1/16/23: $132.24 (Complete)

Now I need to determine if I should include canceled orders or only completed orders. The task asks "how much I spend," which typically means completed transactions. However, let me check one of the orders to better understand the order details and confirm what categories they fall under. Let me view one of the March orders first.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'View Order link for order 000000180 dated 3/11/23'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the page is loading. Let me wait for it to complete.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'duration': 2000}
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c'}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Great! I can see the order details for Order #000000180 from March 11, 2023. This order contains various items including an iPhone case, a monopod, cake toppers, PlayStation skin, and corn muffin mix. These are indeed "shopping" items from One Stop Market. 

Let me scroll down to see the order total and shipping information to understand the complete breakdown.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I can see the complete order total:
- Subtotal: $40.32
- Shipping & Handling: $25.00
- Grand Total: $65.32

This confirms that the order total shown in the order list ($65.32) includes shipping and handling. Now I understand that all these orders from One Stop Market are general shopping orders. Since the task asks about "shopping at One Stop Market," and this is the One Stop Market website, all orders should count.

However, I should check if there are any specific categories I should exclude. Looking at the order, it contains various items (phone case, cake toppers, corn muffin mix, etc.) which are all general shopping items. Since the task doesn't specify to exclude any particular type of items, I should include all completed orders.

Now, let me go back to compile the complete list. Let me navigate back to the orders page.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'My Orders link in the left sidebar'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Let me scroll up to find the My Orders link in the sidebar.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'long'}
[result] Scrolled up by long distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I can now see the sidebar. Let me click on "My Orders" to go back to the order list.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'My Orders link in the left sidebar'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I see the page is loading. Let me wait and then take a screenshot.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'duration': 2000}

[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I'm back on the My Orders page. Now I have all the information I need. Let me compile the spending for January to March 2023. Based on the instructions, I should only count completed orders (not canceled or pending ones), as those are the ones where money was actually spent.

From the orders I've seen:

**March 2023:**
- 3/11/23: $65.32 (Complete) ✓
- 3/10/23: $17.99 (Complete) ✓

**February 2023:**
- 2/27/23: $762.18 (Complete) ✓
- 2/24/23: $231.54 (Canceled) ✗
- 2/11/23: $174.99 (Canceled) ✗
- 2/9/23: $185.32 (Complete) ✓

**January 2023:**
- 1/29/23: $440.64 (Complete) ✓
- 1/16/23: $132.24 (Complete) ✓

Now let me calculate the spending by month:
- **January 2023:** $440.64 + $132.24 = $572.88
- **February 2023:** $762.18 + $185.32 = $947.50
- **March 2023:** $65.32 + $17.99 = $83.31

The task asks "How much I spend each month from Jan to the end of March 2023" which suggests they want a breakdown by month. Let me provide the answer in the format that shows spending for each month.
[tool] mcp__task-completion__complete_task: {'finalAnswer': 'January: 572.88, February: 947.50, March: 83.31'}
[complete] January: 572.88, February: 947.50, March: 83.31
The task is complete! I found all orders from January to March 2023 at One Stop Market and calculated the spending for each month:

- **January 2023:** $572.88 (2 completed orders)
- **February 2023:** $947.50 (2 completed orders) 
- **March 2023:** $83.31 (2 completed orders)

I only counted completed orders as these represent actual spending. Canceled orders were excluded as no money was spent on those.</pre></div><div class='action_object' style='background-color:grey'><pre>{'action_type': <ActionTypes.STOP: 17>, 'coords': array([0., 0.], dtype=float32), 'element_role': 0, 'element_name': '', 'text': [], 'page_number': 0, 'url': '', 'nth': 0, 'pw_code': '', 'element_id': '', 'key_comb': '', 'direction': '', 'answer': 'January: 572.88, February: 947.50, March: 83.31', 'raw_prediction': 'I\'ll help you find out how much was spent each month from January to March 2023 on shopping at One Stop Market.

Let me click on page 2 to see more orders.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'target\': \'page number 2 link in pagination\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI see the page is loading. Let me wait for it to load completely.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'duration\': 2000}\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\'}\n[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\n[result] {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nExcellent! Now I\'m on page 2 and I can see orders from January 2023:\n- 1/29/23: $440.64\n- 1/16/23: $132.24\n\nAnd orders from late 2022. Let me continue checking the other pages. Let me go back to page 1 to get the complete list. I\'ll scroll up first to see the beginning of page 2.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'direction\': \'up\', \'distance\': \'medium\'}\n[result] Scrolled up by medium distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood. Now let me navigate back to page 1 to review all the orders from January to March 2023. However, I realize I need to check each individual order to verify they are from "One Stop Market" and to see what items were purchased (since the task asks specifically about shopping at One Stop Market). Let me click on page 1 first.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'target\': \'page number 1 link in pagination\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI notice I\'m still on page 2. Let me wait for the page to load completely and then try scrolling to see if page 1 loads.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'duration\': 2000}\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\'}\n[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\n[result] {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect! Now I\'m back on page 1. I can see the orders from January to March 2023. Let me compile the list and check if I need to view individual orders. Since the website is "One Stop Market" and I\'m logged into this account, all these orders should be from One Stop Market. However, I need to verify the exact amounts and ensure I\'m counting only the orders from Jan-March 2023.\n\nFrom page 1, I can see:\n- 3/11/23: $65.32 (Complete)\n- 3/10/23: $17.99 (Complete)\n- 2/27/23: $762.18 (Complete)\n- 2/24/23: $231.54 (Canceled)\n- 2/11/23: $174.99 (Canceled)\n- 2/9/23: $185.32 (Complete)\n\nFrom page 2, I saw:\n- 1/29/23: $440.64 (Complete)\n- 1/16/23: $132.24 (Complete)\n\nNow I need to determine if I should include canceled orders or only completed orders. The task asks "how much I spend," which typically means completed transactions. However, let me check one of the orders to better understand the order details and confirm what categories they fall under. Let me view one of the March orders first.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'target\': \'View Order link for order 000000180 dated 3/11/23\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI can see the page is loading. Let me wait for it to complete.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'duration\': 2000}\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\'}\n[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\n[result] {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGreat! I can see the order details for Order #000000180 from March 11, 2023. This order contains various items including an iPhone case, a monopod, cake toppers, PlayStation skin, and corn muffin mix. These are indeed "shopping" items from One Stop Market. \n\nLet me scroll down to see the order total and shipping information to understand the complete breakdown.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'direction\': \'down\', \'distance\': \'medium\'}\n[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect! I can see the complete order total:\n- Subtotal: $40.32\n- Shipping & Handling: $25.00\n- Grand Total: $65.32\n\nThis confirms that the order total shown in the order list ($65.32) includes shipping and handling. Now I understand that all these orders from One Stop Market are general shopping orders. Since the task asks about "shopping at One Stop Market," and this is the One Stop Market website, all orders should count.\n\nHowever, I should check if there are any specific categories I should exclude. Looking at the order, it contains various items (phone case, cake toppers, corn muffin mix, etc.) which are all general shopping items. Since the task doesn\'t specify to exclude any particular type of items, I should include all completed orders.\n\nNow, let me go back to compile the complete list. Let me navigate back to the orders page.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'target\': \'My Orders link in the left sidebar\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nLet me scroll up to find the My Orders link in the sidebar.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'direction\': \'up\', \'distance\': \'long\'}\n[result] Scrolled up by long distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood! I can now see the sidebar. Let me click on "My Orders" to go back to the order list.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'target\': \'My Orders link in the left sidebar\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI see the page is loading.

I\'m back on the My Orders page. Now I have all the information I need. Let me compile the spending for January to March 2023. Based on the instructions, I should only count completed orders (not canceled or pending ones), as those are the ones where money was actually spent.\n\nFrom the orders I\'ve seen:\n\n**March 2023:**\n- 3/11/23: $65.32 (Complete) ✓\n- 3/10/23: $17.99 (Complete) ✓\n\n**February 2023:**\n- 2/27/23: $762.18 (Complete) ✓\n- 2/24/23: $231.54 (Canceled) ✗\n- 2/11/23: $174.99 (Canceled) ✗\n- 2/9/23: $185.32 (Complete) ✓\n\n**January 2023:**\n- 1/29/23: $440.64 (Complete) ✓\n- 1/16/23: $132.24 (Complete) ✓\n\nNow let me calculate the spending by month:\n- **January 2023:** $440.64 + $132.24 = $572.88\n- **February 2023:** $762.18 + $185.32 = $947.50\n- **March 2023:** $65.32 + $17.99 = $83.31\n\nThe task asks "How much I spend each month from Jan to the end of March 2023" which suggests they want a breakdown by month. Let me provide the answer in the format that shows spending for each month.\n[tool] mcp__task-completion__complete_task: {\'finalAnswer\': \'January: 572.88, February: 947.50, March: 83.31\'}\n[complete] January: 572.88, February: 947.50, March: 83.31\nThe task is complete! I found all orders from January to March 2023 at One Stop Market and calculated the spending for each month:\n\n- **January 2023:** $572.88 (2 completed orders)\n- **February 2023:** $947.50 (2 completed orders) \n- **March 2023:** $83.31 (2 completed orders)\n\nI only counted completed orders as these represent actual spending. Canceled orders were excluded as no money was spent on those.'}</pre></div><div class='parsed_action' style='background-color:yellow'><pre>stop [January: 572.88, February: 947.50, March: 83.31]</pre></div></div>
