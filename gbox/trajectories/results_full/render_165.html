Good! I can see we're on a product page for "Sandgrens Swedish Handmade Wooden Clog Sandal | Copenhagen" on an e-commerce website. The product has 4 Reviews. To find the main criticisms, I need to scroll down to read the reviews section where customers would have posted their critical feedback.

Perfect! I can now see all four reviews clearly. Let me extract the main criticisms from each review:

**Review 1 - "So cute but too small" (2 stars by k.d.)**
- Criticism: "The 39 was too small."

**Review 2 - "Toe rubbed" (2 stars by Amazon Customer)**
- Criticism: "I was very sad when the shoe rubbed up against my baby toe. I had to return them because I knew in time it would tear up my feet."

**Review 3 - "Best Shoe Ever" (5 stars by binkabul)**
- No criticisms - this is a positive review

**Review 4 - (3 stars by Stephanie Rowley)**
- Criticism: "The problem is that the strap is made of some really stiff leather and is painful to my heel."
- Criticism: "The front is also uncomfortably tight."

Now I'll provide the final answer with the exact sentences containing criticisms:

[complete] The 39 was too small. I was very sad when the shoe rubbed up against my baby toe. I had to return them because I knew in time it would tear up my feet. The problem is that the strap is made of some really stiff leather and is painful to my heel. The front is also uncomfortably tight.
Task completed! I've extracted all the main criticisms from the product reviews for the Sandgrens Swedish Handmade Wooden Clog Sandal. The criticisms focus on sizing issues (too small), fit problems (rubbing against toes, uncomfortably tight front), and material discomfort (stiff leather strap causing heel pain).</pre></div><div class='action_object' style='background-color:grey'><pre>{'action_type': <ActionTypes.STOP: 17>, 'coords': array([0., 0.], dtype=float32), 'element_role': 0, 'element_name': '', 'text': [], 'page_number': 0, 'url': '', 'nth': 0, 'pw_code': '', 'element_id': '', 'key_comb': '', 'direction': '', 'answer': 'The 39 was too small.
