[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I can see a GitLab instance is open with a list of projects. I need to find the "dotfile" repository to invite yjlou as a guest. Let me switch to the GitLab tab and search for the dotfile repo.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__switch_tab: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'tabId': '2'}
[result] Switched to tab 2 successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the Projects page. I need to search for the "dotfile" repository. Let me use the filter search box to find it.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'Filter by name text input field'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good, the filter field is now focused. Let me type "dotfile" to search for the repository.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'content': 'dotfile', 'pressEnterAfterType': False}
[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see "dotfile" is typed in the filter field, but no results are showing. Let me wait a moment for the filter to apply, then scroll down to see if there are any matching projects.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'duration': 1000}
[result] Finished waiting for 1000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! I found the "dotfiles" repository (Byte Blaze / dotfiles). The filter has worked and I can see it's marked as "Owner" with "Computer setup" as the description. Now I need to click on this repository to open it and then invite yjlou as a guest.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'Byte Blaze / dotfiles project link'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I see the page is loading (there's a loading indicator). Let me wait for the page to fully load.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! The dotfiles repository page has loaded. I can see the project details and a left sidebar with various menu options. To invite yjlou as a guest, I need to access the project members/settings. I can see "Settings" in the left sidebar. Let me click on it.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'Settings menu item in the left sidebar'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! The Settings menu has expanded and I can see a submenu with various options including "General", "Integrations", "Webhooks", etc. However, I don't see a "Members" option in this submenu. Let me scroll down in the Settings submenu to see if there are more options, or I should look for "Project information" which might contain member management.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'short'}
[result] Scrolled down by short distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the General settings page has loaded showing "Badges", "Service Desk", and "Advanced" sections. The settings submenu is still visible on the left. I notice there's no "Members" option in the Settings submenu. In GitLab, member management is typically under "Project information" or there might be a separate "Members" menu item. Let me scroll up to check the main sidebar for a Members option.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled up by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I'm now viewing the General settings page with sections like "Naming, topics, avatar" and "Visibility, project features, permissions". I need to find the Members section. Looking at the left sidebar, I can see the main menu items. Let me look for a "Members" or "Project members" option. Let me click on "Project information" to see if members management is there.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'Project information menu item in the left sidebar'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I can see that clicking on "Project information" has expanded a submenu showing "Activity", "Labels", and "Members". I can see "Members" in this submenu. Let me click on it to access the member management page.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'Members menu item in the Project information submenu'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see that I'm now on a page showing Activity with tabs including "All", "Push events", "Merge events", etc. However, this appears to be the Activity page, not the Members page. The URL shows "/-/project_members" but I'm seeing activity. Let me wait for the page to load completely, or let me click directly on "Members" again as it might not have loaded properly.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'duration': 1500}
[result] Finished waiting for 1500ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I'm on the "Project members" page. I can see:
- Current members: Abishek S (Guest role) and Byte Blaze (Owner role)
- There's an "Invite members" button in the top right

I need to click on "Invite members" to invite yjlou as a guest to the repository.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'Invite members button in the top right corner'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! An "Invite members" dialog has appeared. I can see:
- A text field for "Username or email address" with placeholder text "Select members or type email addresses"
- A "Select a role" dropdown currently set to "Guest" (which is perfect for our needs)
- An optional "Access expiration date" field
- "Cancel" and "Invite" buttons

Now I need to type "yjlou" in the username field. Let me click on the input field first and then type the username.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'Username or email address input field'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! The input field is now focused (I can see the blue border around it). Now I'll type "yjlou" to search for this user.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'content': 'yjlou', 'pressEnterAfterType': False}
[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! A dropdown has appeared showing a user "yjlou" with username "yjlou". This is exactly who I need to invite. I can see the role is already set to "Guest" which is correct. Now I need to click on the "yjlou" option in the dropdown to select this user.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'yjlou user option in the dropdown'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! The user "yjlou" has been selected and I can see it now appears as a tag in the input field. The settings are:
- Username: yjlou (selected)
- Role: Guest (already set correctly)
- Access expiration date: (optional, left blank)

Now I need to click the "Invite" button to send the invitation to yjlou as a guest to the dotfiles repository.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'Invite button'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the page is loading (there's a loading indicator in the tab). Let me wait for the invitation to be processed.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! The task has been completed successfully! I can see:

1. A success message at the top: "Members were successfully added"
2. The member count has increased from 2 to 3 members
3. **yjlou** now appears in the members list with:
   - Username: yjlou (@yjlou)
   - Role: **Guest** (exactly as requested)
   - Access granted: "just now by Byte Blaze"
   - Source: Direct member

The invitation has been successfully completed. yjlou has been invited to the dotfiles repository as a guest.
[tool] mcp__task-completion__complete_task: {'finalAnswer': 'Successfully invited yjlou to the dotfiles repository as a guest. The member was added with Guest role permissions.'}
