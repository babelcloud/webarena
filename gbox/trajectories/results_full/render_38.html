Good! I can see the OpenStreetMap interface is already open. There's a welcome popup that I need to close first. I can see Pittsburgh on the map. Now I need to:
1. Close the welcome popup
2. Search for directions from Pittsburgh Airport to Duquesne University
3. Check the estimated travel time by car

Let me close the welcome popup first:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'X button to close the Welcome to OpenStreetMap popup in the top right corner of the popup'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! The popup is closed. Now I can see the OpenStreetMap interface with a search bar at the top left. I need to get directions from Pittsburgh Airport to Duquesne University. Let me click on the search bar and search for directions. First, I'll need to access the directions feature. I can see there's a "Where is this?" link next to the search bar. Let me click on the search bar and look for directions options.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Search input field at the top left of the page'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the search field is active. I notice there's a directions icon (the icon that looks like arrows) next to the "Go" button. Let me click on that icon to access the directions feature instead of just searching.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Blue directions icon button with arrows next to the Go button'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! The directions panel has opened. I can see:
- A "From" field (with a green marker icon)
- A "To" field (with a red marker icon)
- A dropdown menu set to "Car (OSRM)" which is perfect for this task
- A "Go" button
- A "Reverse Directions" link

Now I need to enter:
- From: Pittsburgh Airport
- To: Duquesne University

Let me start by clicking on the "From" field and entering Pittsburgh Airport:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'From input field with green marker icon'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good, the "From" field is now active (I can see the cursor is in the field). Now let me type "Pittsburgh Airport":
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'content': 'Pittsburgh Airport', 'pressEnterAfterType': False}
[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I've typed "Pittsburgh Airport" in the From field. Now I need to wait a moment to see if autocomplete suggestions appear, or I can click on the "To" field and enter the destination. Let me wait a moment to see if suggestions appear:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'duration': 1500}
[result] Finished waiting for 1500ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I don't see any autocomplete suggestions appearing. Let me now click on the "To" field to enter the destination (Duquesne University):
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'To input field with red marker icon'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! I can see that the "From" field has been auto-completed to "Pittsburgh International Airport People Mo" (appears to be truncated in the display), and I can see a green marker has appeared on the map in the Pittsburgh area. Now the "To" field is active. Let me type "Duquesne University":
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'content': 'Duquesne University Pittsburgh', 'pressEnterAfterType': False}
[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I can see both fields are now filled in:
- From: "Pittsburgh International Airport People Mo"
- To: "Duquesne University Pittsburgh"

The transport mode is already set to "Car (OSRM)" which is what we need. Now let me click the "Go" button to get the directions and travel time:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Go button in blue color next to the Car (OSRM) dropdown'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Great! I can see the system is loading the route. I can see:
- A loading spinner in the left panel
- The destination has been refined to "Duquesne University, Academic Walk, Soho" (visible in the To field)
- Both markers (green for start, red for destination) are visible on the map in the Pittsburgh area
- The URL has changed to include routing parameters

Let me wait for the results to load:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'duration': 3000}
[result] Finished waiting for 3000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! The route has loaded successfully. I can see the key information in the "Directions" panel on the left:

**Distance: 33km. Time: 0:32.**

This shows that the drive from Pittsburgh International Airport to Duquesne University is:
- Distance: 33 kilometers
- Time: 0:32 (32 minutes)

Since 32 minutes is less than 60 minutes (one hour), **YES, Duquesne University in Pittsburgh can be reached in one hour by car from Pittsburgh Airport.**

The route is clearly shown on the map in purple/blue, going from the airport (west) to downtown Pittsburgh where Duquesne University is located (marked with the red pin).
[tool] mcp__task-completion__complete_task: {'finalAnswer': 'Yes, Duquesne University in Pittsburgh can be reached in one hour by car from Pittsburgh Airport. The driving distance is 33km and takes approximately 32 minutes.'}
[complete] Yes, Duquesne University in Pittsburgh can be reached in one hour by car from Pittsburgh Airport. The driving distance is 33km and takes approximately 32 minutes.
The task is complete! According to OpenStreetMap's routing data, Duquesne University can definitely be reached from Pittsburgh Airport in under one hour by car - it takes approximately 32 minutes to cover the 33km distance.</pre></div><div class='action_object' style='background-color:grey'><pre>{'action_type': <ActionTypes.STOP: 17>, 'coords': array([0., 0.], dtype=float32), 'element_role': 0, 'element_name': '', 'text': [], 'page_number': 0, 'url': '', 'nth': 0, 'pw_code': '', 'element_id': '', 'key_comb': '', 'direction': '', 'answer': 'Yes, Duquesne University in Pittsburgh can be reached in one hour by car from Pittsburgh Airport.
