[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__list_tabs: {'boxId': 'def8426c-3556-4dc9-be78-05f463ca6f95'}
[result] {
  "data": [

      "url": "chrome://new-tab-page/",
      "favicon": "chrome://new-tab-page/favicon.ico",
      "active": true,
      "loading": false
Good! I can see there are 2 tabs open. Tab 2 appears to be a GitLab Dashboard. Let me switch to that tab and take a screenshot to see the current state.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__switch_tab: {'boxId': 'def8426c-3556-4dc9-be78-05f463ca6f95', 'tabId': '2'}
[result] Switched to tab 2 successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I'm on a GitLab dashboard showing various projects. To find issues with "theme editor" in the title, I need to navigate to the Issues section. I can see there's a navigation bar at the top. Let me look for an Issues link or navigate to the issues page. Let me click on the GitLab logo or use the menu to access issues.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'def8426c-3556-4dc9-be78-05f463ca6f95', 'target': 'Menu icon (three horizontal lines) in the top left corner next to the GitLab logo'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the page is loading. Let me wait a moment for it to complete, then try to access the Issues section. I notice there are navigation icons in the top right. Let me look for the Issues icon or use the search functionality.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {'boxId': 'def8426c-3556-4dc9-be78-05f463ca6f95'}
[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the GitLab dashboard with various projects. To find issues with "theme editor" in the title, I need to navigate to the Issues section. I can see there's an icon in the top navigation that looks like it could be for issues. Let me look for the issues icon in the top right corner of the navigation bar.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'def8426c-3556-4dc9-be78-05f463ca6f95', 'target': 'Icon with checkmark or list icon in the top right navigation bar'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
That opened a user profile menu. Let me close this and look for a different way to access issues. Let me click elsewhere to close this menu first, then try to find the issues section through the main navigation.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': 'def8426c-3556-4dc9-be78-05f463ca6f95', 'keys': ['escape']}
[result] Keys pressed successfully
Now let me look for the Issues section. In GitLab, there's usually an Issues link in the navigation. Let me click on the icon that looks like it might be for issues or merge requests. I can see several icons in the top right - let me try clicking on one that might lead to issues.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'def8426c-3556-4dc9-be78-05f463ca6f95', 'target': 'Icon that looks like a clipboard or list with a checkmark, located in the top navigation bar to the left of the user profile icon'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I see the page is loading. Let me wait a moment and then take a screenshot to see if anything changed.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'def8426c-3556-4dc9-be78-05f463ca6f95', 'duration': 1000}
[result] Finished waiting for 1000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I'm still on the projects page. Let me try a different approach - I'll use the hamburger menu (three horizontal lines) on the left to access the Issues section.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'def8426c-3556-4dc9-be78-05f463ca6f95', 'target': 'Three horizontal lines menu icon on the far left of the top navigation bar, next to the GitLab logo'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! A menu has opened on the left side. I can see:
- Switch to (with Projects and Groups)
- Explore section (with Milestones, Snippets, Activity)

I don't see "Issues" directly in this menu. Let me look for it in the Explore section or I might need to access it differently. Let me try clicking on "Activity" to see if that shows issues, or I should close this and look for issues in a different way.

Let me try a more direct approach - I'll navigate directly to the issues page by typing in the search bar or modifying the URL. Let me close this menu first and try using the search functionality.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': 'def8426c-3556-4dc9-be78-05f463ca6f95', 'keys': ['escape']}
[result] Keys pressed successfully
Now let me try using the search bar at the top to search for issues with "theme editor" in the title. I'll click on the search bar and type my search query.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'def8426c-3556-4dc9-be78-05f463ca6f95', 'target': 'Search GitLab search bar at the top of the page'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! The search bar has opened and I can see several quick link options:
- All GitLab
- Issues assigned to me
- Issues I've created
- Merge requests assigned to me
- Merge requests that I'm a reviewer
- Merge requests I've created

Perfect! I can see "Issues I've created" which would show my issues. Let me click on that option to see all the issues I've created.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'def8426c-3556-4dc9-be78-05f463ca6f95', 'target': "Issues I've created option in the dropdown menu"}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The page seems to still be loading or it went back to the projects page. Let me wait a moment for the page to fully load.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'def8426c-3556-4dc9-be78-05f463ca6f95', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I'm on the Issues page showing issues created by me (Byte Blaze). I can see several issues listed. The page shows:
- Open: 19
- Closed: 59
- All: 78

The issues are currently sorted by "Updated date". I need to find the issue with "theme editor" in the title. I can see several issues on the current page, but I don't see "theme editor" yet. Let me scroll down to look for it, or I should look at the sorting/filtering. Since the task asks for the "latest updated issue that has keyword 'theme editor'", and it's currently sorted by "Updated date", let me scroll down to look for issues with "theme editor" in the title.

Let me scroll down to see more issues.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'def8426c-3556-4dc9-be78-05f463ca6f95', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see more issues now, but I still don't see "theme editor" in any of the titles. Let me continue scrolling down to find the issue with "theme editor" in the title.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'def8426c-3556-4dc9-be78-05f463ca6f95', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The page seems to not have scrolled much. Let me try a different approach. Instead of scrolling through all issues, let me use the search functionality to filter for issues with "theme editor" in the title. Let me scroll back up to use the search filter.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'def8426c-3556-4dc9-be78-05f463ca6f95', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled up by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I'm back at the top of the issues page. I can see there's a search filter area. I notice there's already a filter "Author = Byte Blaze". Now I need to add a search term to filter for "theme editor". Let me click in the search area to add a search filter for "theme editor".
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'def8426c-3556-4dc9-be78-05f463ca6f95', 'target': 'Search or filter input field in the filter area, to the left of where it says "Author = Byte Blaze"'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
A dropdown menu appeared showing different author options. Let me close this and instead look for a way to search by title. Let me press Escape to close this dropdown and then look for a search input field.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': 'def8426c-3556-4dc9-be78-05f463ca6f95', 'keys': ['escape']}
[result] Keys pressed successfully
Now let me use the Search GitLab search bar at the top to search for issues with "theme editor" in the title. Let me click on that search bar.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'def8426c-3556-4dc9-be78-05f463ca6f95', 'target': 'Search GitLab text input field at the top of the page in the navigation bar'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! The search dropdown opened again. Now let me type "theme editor" in the search field to search for issues with that keyword.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {'boxId': 'def8426c-3556-4dc9-be78-05f463ca6f95', 'content': 'theme editor', 'pressEnterAfterType': True}
[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! The search has been initiated and I can see it's searching for "theme editor" in all GitLab. There's a loading indicator showing. Let me wait for the search results to load.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'def8426c-3556-4dc9-be78-05f463ca6f95', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! The search results page has loaded. I can see:
- Projects: 0
- Issues: 14
- Merge requests: 5
- Milestones: 0
- Users: 0

There are 14 issues matching "theme editor"! Let me click on "Issues" to see those issues.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'def8426c-3556-4dc9-be78-05f463ca6f95', 'target': 'Issues link showing 14 results on the left sidebar'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The page seems to be loading. Let me wait for the issues to load.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'def8426c-3556-4dc9-be78-05f463ca6f95', 'duration': 2000}

Excellent! The issues have loaded. I can see 14 issues matching "theme editor". The issues are currently sorted by "Created date". However, I need to find the LATEST UPDATED issue with "theme editor" in the title. Let me change the sort order to "Updated date" by clicking on the "Created date" dropdown.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'def8426c-3556-4dc9-be78-05f463ca6f95', 'target': 'Created date dropdown button in the top right area of the issues list'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! A dropdown menu appeared with sorting options:
- Created date (currently selected)
- Updated date
- Popularity

I need to select "Updated date" to find the latest updated issue with "theme editor" in the title.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'def8426c-3556-4dc9-be78-05f463ca6f95', 'target': 'Updated date option in the dropdown menu'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I can see the URL has changed to include "&sort=updated_desc" which means it's now sorting by updated date in descending order. The page is loading. Let me wait for it to fully load and then take a screenshot to see the issues sorted by latest updated.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'def8426c-3556-4dc9-be78-05f463ca6f95', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now the issues are sorted by "Updated date" (in descending order, so most recently updated first). I can see the first issue at the top is:

**"Tm Theme Editor"** - marked as "Open"
- Created by Byte Blaze in a11y-syntax-highlighting #1
- Created 5 years ago by earle
- **Updated 2 years ago**

This is the latest updated issue with "theme editor" in the title. The status shows "Open" which means it is NOT closed. Now I need to click on this issue to verify its status and get more details.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'def8426c-3556-4dc9-be78-05f463ca6f95', 'target': 'Tm Theme Editor link at the top of the issues list'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The page is loading. I can see at the bottom of the page there's a URL that suggests it's navigating to the issue. Let me wait for the page to fully load.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'def8426c-3556-4dc9-be78-05f463ca6f95', 'duration': 2000}

Let me look for it in the Explore section or I might need to access it differently. Let me try clicking on "Activity" to see if that shows issues, or I should close this and look for issues in a different way.\n\nLet me try a more direct approach - I\'ll navigate directly to the issues page by typing in the search bar or modifying the URL.

I can see "Issues I\'ve created" which would show my issues.

The page shows:\n- Open: 19\n- Closed: 59\n- All: 78\n\nThe issues are currently sorted by "Updated date". I need to find the issue with "theme editor" in the title. I can see several issues on the current page, but I don\'t see "theme editor" yet. Let me scroll down to look for it, or I should look at the sorting/filtering. Since the task asks for the "latest updated issue that has keyword \'theme editor\'", and it\'s currently sorted by "Updated date", let me scroll down to look for issues with "theme editor" in the title.\n\nLet me scroll down to see more issues.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'def8426c-3556-4dc9-be78-05f463ca6f95\', \'direction\': \'down\', \'distance\': \'medium\'}\n[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI can see more issues now, but I still don\'t see "theme editor" in any of the titles.

I\'m back at the top of the issues page. I can see there\'s a search filter area. I notice there\'s already a filter "Author = Byte Blaze".
