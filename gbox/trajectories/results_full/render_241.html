Let me start by checking what tabs are currently open and taking a screenshot to see the current state.

[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I can see the One Stop Market homepage is already open. Now I need to navigate to the "Beauty & Personal Care" category to find the skin care tool category. I can see the navigation menu at the top with "Beauty & Personal Care" as the first option.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Beauty & Personal Care menu item in the top navigation bar'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! The Beauty & Personal Care dropdown menu has appeared. I can see several subcategories including:
- Oral Care
- Skin Care
- Makeup
- Foot, Hand & Nail Care
- Hair Care
- Tools & Accessories
- Fragrance
- Personal Care
- Shave & Hair Removal
- Salon & Spa Equipment

I need to click on "Skin Care" to find the skin care tool category.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Skin Care menu item in the dropdown menu'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I'm now on the Beauty & Personal Care page. I can see on the left sidebar under "Category" there's a "Skin Care" option with 3074 items. I need to click on that to filter specifically for skin care products. Then I'll look for the "skin care tool" subcategory.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Skin Care link showing 3074 items in the Category section on the left sidebar'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I'm now viewing Skin Care products (3074 items). I can see the left sidebar now shows different subcategories under "Category":
- Sunscreens & Tanning Products (100)
- Face (1161)
- Lip Care (373)
- Maternity (218)
- Eyes (248)
- Sets & Kits (196)
- Body (754)

I need to scroll down to see if there's a "Skin Care Tool" or "Tools" category in the list. Let me scroll down on the left sidebar to see more options.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I scrolled down but I can see some products including what looks like facial rollers (BK Cube Ice Facial Roller) which could be skin care tools. Let me scroll back up to see the left sidebar categories again to find if there's a specific "Skin Care Tool" category or I may need to search for it differently.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled up by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I can see the left sidebar again with the Category options. I can see:
- Sunscreens & Tanning Products (100)
- Face (1161)
- Lip Care (373)
- Maternity (218)
- Eyes (248)
- Sets & Kits (196)
- Body (754)

I notice there's more categories below "Body". Let me scroll down in the left sidebar specifically to see if there's a "Skin Care Tool" or "Tools" category. Let me click on the area below "Body" to see more options.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'short'}
[result] Scrolled down by short distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see more products now. I notice there are some tools visible like "EVO FLEX Sunnies Flexible Tanning Bed Goggles UV Eye Protection Glasses 4 Pack (Black), FDA Compliant" and the "BK Cube Ice Facial Roller" that I saw earlier. However, I need to find the specific "Skin Care Tool" category. Let me scroll back up to access the left sidebar and look for more category options, or I should use the search functionality to specifically search for "skin care tool" to filter the products more efficiently.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled up by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I can see the left sidebar again. I can see the categories listed:
- Sunscreens & Tanning Products (100)
- Face (1161)
- Lip Care (373)
- Maternity (218)
- Eyes (248)
- Sets & Kits (196)
- Body (754)

I need to check if there are more categories below "Body". Let me look more carefully at the sidebar. I should scroll down within the sidebar area to see if there's a "Skin Care Tool" category. However, a more efficient approach would be to use the search bar to search for "skin care tool" directly. Let me scroll to the very top to access the search bar.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'long'}
[result] Scrolled up by long distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I can now see the search bar at the top. I'll use it to search for "skin care tool" to find products in that specific category. This will be much more efficient than scrolling through all 3074 items.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Search entire store here text input field in the top right area'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! The search field is now active (I can see the cursor should be in the field). Now I'll type "skin care tool" to search for products in that category.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'content': 'skin care tool', 'pressEnterAfterType': True}
[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the search has been entered ("skin care tool" is in the search box) but the page is still loading. Let me wait for the results to load.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! The search results for "skin care tool" have loaded. I can see there are 27,813 items in the results. I can see several skin care tools displayed:

1. DDP PROFESSIONAL "LANCET" AND EXTRACTOR SKIN CARE TOOL - $7.79
2. Tweezerman No-Slip Skin Care Tool Model No. 2742-R - $11.70
3. 9 in 1 Body Machine, Skin Care Tools, Skin Care for Salon Spa Home Use - $599.00
4. Oil-Absorbing Volcanic Roller Reusable Mini Face Massage Convenient Facial Skin Care Tool - $1.89

The most expensive product visible so far is the "9 in 1 Body Machine" at $599.00. However, since there are 27,813 items, I should sort by price (highest to lowest) to find the most expensive skin care tool. Let me change the sort option from "Relevance" to price (descending).
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Sort By dropdown menu showing Relevance'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! The sort dropdown menu has opened and I can see the options:
- Product Name
- Price
- Relevance (currently selected)

I need to click on "Price" to sort by price. This should show me the products sorted by price, and I'll need to verify if it's ascending or descending.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Price option in the dropdown menu'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! The sort option has been changed to "Price" and I can see the page is loading (there's a loading indicator in the tab). The products are still showing the same order. Let me wait for the page to fully reload with the new sort order.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! The page has reloaded and is now sorted by price. I can see the URL has changed to include "product_list_order=price". Looking at the products displayed, I can see:

1. JTxop Wood Platform Bed with Headboard... - $28,942.99
2. JTxop Solid Wood Platform Bed Frame... - $28,830.99
3. JTxop Platform Bed Frame with Upholstered Headboard... - $28,283.99
4. QFWCJ 4k Short Throw Projector... - $17,774.32

These are very expensive items, but they don't look like skin care tools - they appear to be beds and projectors. The sorting seems to be showing the highest prices first (descending order), which is what I need. However, these products don't seem relevant to "skin care tool" category. Let me scroll down to see if there are actual skin care tools, or I need to check if there's an arrow to reverse the sort order to see if it's actually sorting ascending.

Let me look at the sort dropdown - I notice there's an up arrow next to the dropdown. Let me click on it to reverse the sort order.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'up arrow icon next to the Price dropdown menu to change sort direction'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The page is loading again. The same products are still showing - the very expensive beds and projector. I notice the arrow is now pointing down, which suggests the sort order has been reversed. Let me wait for the page to fully load.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I see the sort order has been reversed! Now it's showing products sorted from lowest to highest price (ascending). I can see items priced at $0.01. The URL now includes "product_list_dir=asc" confirming ascending order.

I need to reverse it back to descending order (highest price first) to find the most expensive skin care tool. Let me click the arrow again to sort from highest to lowest price.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'up arrow icon next to the Price dropdown to change sort direction to descending'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The page is loading. Let me wait for it to complete.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! Now I'm back to showing the highest priced items first (descending order). The URL no longer has "product_list_dir=asc". I can see:

1. JTxop Wood Platform Bed - $28,942.99
2. JTxop Solid Wood Platform Bed Frame - $28,830.99
3. JTxop Platform Bed Frame - $28,283.99
4. QFWCJ 4k Short Throw Projector - $17,774.32

However, these items (beds and projectors) don't appear to be actual "skin care tools." The search for "skin care tool" is returning too broad results - it's matching any product that contains those words anywhere. 

I need to filter more specifically. Let me look at the left sidebar to filter by the "Beauty & Personal Care" category to narrow down the results to actual skin care tools. I can see "Beauty & Personal Care (12336)" in the category list.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Beauty & Personal Care link showing 12336 items in the Category section on the left sidebar'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The page appears unchanged. The click might not have registered or it's loading. Let me wait a moment and then take another screenshot to see if it updates.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The page hasn't changed - still showing beds and projectors. The issue is that my search for "skin care tool" is too broad and includes products from all categories. Let me try a different approach. 

I should navigate to the actual "Skin Care Tool" category if it exists in the website structure. Let me scroll down to see if I can see more categories in the left sidebar, or I should look for a subcategory filter. Let me scroll down in the left sidebar area.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'short'}
[result] Scrolled down by short distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see more expensive items now:
- Black Portable Projection Screen - $12,947.00
- LEAQU Sectional Sofa - $7,662.03
- Back Adjustable Disabled Electric Home Hospital Bed - $5,333.67
- Luxury Contemporary U Shape Sofa - $4,500.00

I can also see a massage chair (TEAMOR Luxury Supercar Massage) which could be closer to a "skin care tool." Let me continue scrolling down to see more products and find actual skin care tools.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I can now see more items:
- Sony XR65A90J 65" OLED TV - $4,498.00
- TEAMOR Luxury Supercar Massage Chair - $4,400.00
- Divani Casa 2263 - Luxury Modern Contemporary Leather Sectional Sofa - $4,270.00
- My Aashis Luxury Modern Ravenna L-Shaped Corner Sectional Sofa - $3,950.00

I can see that I'm on page 1 of the results (there are pagination numbers at the bottom: 1 2 3 4 5). The massage chair at $4,400.00 is the closest thing to a skin care tool I've seen so far. However, I'm concerned that these results include items like beds, sofas, and TVs that aren't actually skin care tools.

Let me try a better approach. Let me go back to the beginning and navigate directly to the Beauty & Personal Care category, then look for a specific "Skin Care Tool" subcategory. Let me click on "Beauty & Personal Care" from the top menu.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'long'}
[result] Scrolled up by long distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see I'm back viewing the top of the results. I can see in the left sidebar there are categories including "Video Games", "Grocery & Gourmet Food", "Cell Phones & Accessories". Let me scroll up more to see the navigation menu and try a different approach. Let me look at the URL - I need to navigate specifically to the Skin Care category within Beauty & Personal Care, then look for a "Skin Care Tool" subcategory.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'long'}
[result] Scrolled up by long distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good, I'm back at the top. I realize the issue - when I search for "skin care tool", it's searching across ALL products in the entire store, not just within a specific category. 

Let me try a different approach. Let me navigate directly to Beauty & Personal Care > Skin Care first to narrow down the context, then look for a "Skin Care Tool" subcategory. Let me click on "Beauty & Personal Care" in the navigation menu.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Beauty & Personal Care navigation menu item'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! The Beauty & Personal Care dropdown menu has appeared. I can see "Tools & Accessories" in the list! This is likely where skin care tools would be categorized. Let me click on it.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Tools & Accessories menu item in the Beauty & Personal Care dropdown'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! I'm now on the Beauty & Personal Care page and I can see "Tools & Accessories (3451)" in the left sidebar. Let me click on it to filter specifically for tools and accessories.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Tools & Accessories link showing 3451 items in the Category section on the left sidebar'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I'm viewing "Tools & Accessories" (3451 items) and I can see subcategories in the left sidebar:
- Bags & Cases (1337)
- Makeup Brushes & Tools (1000)
- Refillable Containers (118)
- Mirrors (617)
- **Skin Care Tools (223)**
- Cotton Balls & Swabs (148)

Excellent! There's a "Skin Care Tools" subcategory with 223 items. Let me click on it.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Skin Care Tools link showing 223 items in the Category section on the left sidebar'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The page is loading. I can see "Skin Care Tools (223)" is now underlined in the left sidebar, indicating it's been selected. Let me wait for the page to fully load with the filtered results.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I'm viewing the "Skin Care Tools" category with 223 items. I can see products like:
- Cenglings Women's High Waist Tummy Control Textured Shorts - $7.18
- Microcurrent Eye Massage patch - $28.99
- Trophy Skin RejuvatonMD - Microcurrent Facial Toning System - $199.99
- LIMNGO 3.75" Premium Nose Hair Scissors - $9.99

Now I need to sort by price (highest to lowest) to find the most expensive skin care tool. Let me click on the Sort By dropdown and select Price.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Sort By dropdown menu showing Position'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! The dropdown menu has opened showing:
- Position (currently selected)
- Product Name
- Price

Let me click on "Price" to sort by price.

Good! The sort has been changed to "Price" and the page is loading. Let me wait for it to complete.

Excellent! The page has loaded and is now sorted by price. I can see the products are now showing from lowest to highest price:

2. Skin Tag Remover Patches - $2.43
3. Stainless Steel Face Hair Removal Tools - $2.82
4. Grey990 Profession Nose Pore Cleaning Brush - $3.12

The URL shows "product_list_order=price" which confirms it's sorting by price, but it's in ascending order (lowest to highest). I need to reverse this to descending order (highest to lowest) to find the most expensive item. Let me click on the arrow next to the dropdown to reverse the sort order.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'up arrow icon next to the Price dropdown to change sort direction to descending'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The page is loading. Let me wait for it to complete loading with the reversed sort order.

Let me scroll down to see if there are actual skin care tools, or I need to check if there\'s an arrow to reverse the sort order to see if it\'s actually sorting ascending.\n\nLet me look at the sort dropdown - I notice there\'s an up arrow next to the dropdown.

The issue is that my search for "skin care tool" is too broad and includes products from all categories. Let me try a different approach. \n\nI should navigate to the actual "Skin Care Tool" category if it exists in the website structure. Let me scroll down to see if I can see more categories in the left sidebar, or I should look for a subcategory filter.

The massage chair at $4,400.00 is the closest thing to a skin care tool I\'ve seen so far. However, I\'m concerned that these results include items like beds, sofas, and TVs that aren\'t actually skin care tools.\n\nLet me try a better approach.

I can see in the left sidebar there are categories including "Video Games", "Grocery & Gourmet Food", "Cell Phones & Accessories".

I realize the issue - when I search for "skin care tool", it\'s searching across ALL products in the entire store, not just within a specific category. \n\nLet me try a different approach. Let me navigate directly to Beauty & Personal Care > Skin Care first to narrow down the context, then look for a "Skin Care Tool" subcategory. Let me click on "Beauty & Personal Care" in the navigation menu.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'target\': \'Beauty & Personal Care navigation menu item\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect! The Beauty & Personal Care dropdown menu has appeared. I can see "Tools & Accessories" in the list! This is likely where skin care tools would be categorized. Let me click on it.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'target\': \'Tools & Accessories menu item in the Beauty & Personal Care dropdown\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nExcellent! I\'m now on the Beauty & Personal Care page and I can see "Tools & Accessories (3451)" in the left sidebar. Let me click on it to filter specifically for tools and accessories.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'target\': \'Tools & Accessories link showing 3451 items in the Category section on the left sidebar\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect! Now I\'m viewing "Tools & Accessories" (3451 items) and I can see subcategories in the left sidebar:\n- Bags & Cases (1337)\n- Makeup Brushes & Tools (1000)\n- Refillable Containers (118)\n- Mirrors (617)\n- **Skin Care Tools (223)**\n- Cotton Balls & Swabs (148)\n\nExcellent! There\'s a "Skin Care Tools" subcategory with 223 items. Let me click on it.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'target\': \'Skin Care Tools link showing 223 items in the Category section on the left sidebar\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nThe page is loading. I can see "Skin Care Tools (223)" is now underlined in the left sidebar, indicating it\'s been selected. Let me wait for the page to fully load with the filtered results.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'duration\': 2000}\n[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect!

Let me click on the Sort By dropdown and select Price.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'target\': \'Sort By dropdown menu showing Position\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect!

I need to reverse this to descending order (highest to lowest) to find the most expensive item. Let me click on the arrow next to the dropdown to reverse the sort order.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'target\': \'up arrow icon next to the Price dropdown to change sort direction to descending\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nThe page is loading.
