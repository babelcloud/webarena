Good! I can see a GitLab dashboard showing "Yours 14" tab which displays projects. I need to find repositories where I made contributions but they have 0 stars. Looking at the current view, I can see several projects with star counts (shown with the ★ icon):

From what I can see so far:
- **cloud-to-butt**: ★ 0
- **dotfiles**: ★ 0  
- **gimmiethat.space**: ★ 0

However, I need to check if I made contributions to these repositories (not just if I'm the owner). I also need to scroll down to see all 14 projects to ensure I capture all repositories with 0 stars where I contributed. Let me scroll down to see more projects.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I can see more projects now. Let me continue scrolling to see all remaining projects to make sure I capture all repositories with 0 stars.

Additional repositories with 0 stars that I can see:
- **remove-board-movement-events-from-the-github-issue-timeline**: ★ 0
- **solarized-prism-theme**: ★ 0
- **timeit**: ★ 0

Let me scroll down a bit more to see if there are any remaining projects.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the page hasn't changed much. Let me scroll back to the top to get a complete view of all projects and then check each repository to see if I made contributions to them.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'keys': ['home']}

[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! Now I can see the list clearly. I need to check which repositories I made contributions to that have 0 stars. I can see the following repositories with 0 stars:

- **Byte Blaze / cloud-to-butt** - ★ 0, Owner
- **Byte Blaze / dotfiles** - ★ 0, Owner
- **Byte Blaze / gimmiethat.space** - ★ 0, Owner

However, I see labels like "Owner", "Maintainer", "Developer" which indicate my role. The task asks for repositories where I made **contributions**. Let me think about this:

1. Being an "Owner" means I created/own the repository
2. The task asks for repositories where I made "contributions"

I need to check if there are more repositories below and also understand if "contributions" means I contributed to someone else's repository or if it includes repositories I own. Let me scroll down to see all 14 projects first to get the complete list.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'keys': ['end']}

[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I can see more repositories. Let me compile the complete list of repositories with 0 stars. I notice the task asks for repositories where "I made contributions" - this could mean either repositories I own/contribute to, or specifically repositories where I'm a contributor (not owner). 

Since this is under the "Yours" tab (showing 14 projects), these are all repositories where I have some involvement. Let me check if I need to look at the contribution history to determine which ones I actually contributed to, or if the presence under "Yours" tab counts as contributions.

Looking at the repositories with 0 stars visible on screen:
- **Byte Blaze / cloud-to-butt** - ★ 0, Owner
- **Byte Blaze / dotfiles** - ★ 0, Owner
- **Byte Blaze / gimmiethat.space** - ★ 0, Owner
- **Byte Blaze / remove-board-movement-events-from-the-github-issue-timeline** - ★ 0, Owner
- **Byte Blaze / solarized-prism-theme** - ★ 0, Owner
- **Byte Blaze / timeit** - ★ 0, Owner

However, I also notice "Primer / design" which shows "Developer" role - this means I'm a developer/contributor but not the owner. Let me check if there are any repositories where I'm listed as a contributor/developer (not owner) that have 0 stars, as that might be what the task is asking for.

Let me click on one of the repositories to check the contributions more carefully, or let me look for a way to see my actual contributions. Let me click on my profile or check if there's a contributions view.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'user profile icon in the top right corner of the navigation bar'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! A dropdown menu appeared. Let me click on "Byte Blaze" or "@byteblaze" to go to the profile page where I might see a contribution overview.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Byte Blaze username link in the dropdown menu'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I see the URL changed to the profile page but the content still shows the projects list. Let me wait for the page to load and take a screenshot.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! Now I'm on the Byte Blaze profile page. I can see there are several tabs including "Contributed projects" which is exactly what I need. Let me click on that tab to see which projects I contributed to.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Contributed projects tab in the navigation menu'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I'm now on the "Contributed projects" tab. I can see only ONE project where I made contributions:

**The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com** - ★ 21, Maintainer

This project has 21 stars, NOT 0 stars. So this doesn't match the criteria.

Now let me check the "Personal projects" tab to see all my personal projects and identify which ones have 0 stars. Let me click on that tab.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Personal projects tab in the navigation menu'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Great! Now I'm on the "Personal projects" tab. I can see several projects with 0 stars:

1. **dotfiles** - ★ 0
2. **timeit** - ★ 0
3. **solarized-prism-theme** - ★ 0
4. **gimmiethat.space** - ★ 0
5. **cloud-to-butt** - ★ 0

Let me scroll down to see if there are more projects with 0 stars.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I can see more projects now. Let me identify the additional projects with 0 stars:

6. **remove-board-movement-events-from-the-github-issue-timeline** - ★ 0

Now let me understand the task better. The task asks for "repositories where I made contributions and they got no stars". 

Looking at the "Contributed projects" tab, I only contributed to **The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com** which has 21 stars, so that doesn't meet the criteria.

However, the "Personal projects" are projects I own/created. The question is whether creating/owning a project counts as "making contributions" to it. In typical GitLab/GitHub terminology:
- **Contributed projects** = projects where I contributed but don't own
- **Personal projects** = projects I own/created

Since I found NO repositories in the "Contributed projects" tab with 0 stars, and the only project there has 21 stars, let me verify if the task is asking about personal projects where I made contributions (as the owner/creator).

Let me go back to check if there's another interpretation. Let me click on the "Contributed projects" tab again to make absolutely sure I didn't miss anything.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Contributed projects tab in the navigation menu'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I see a menu opened. Let me close this and try clicking on "Contributed projects" tab again.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'keys': ['escape']}
[result] Keys pressed successfully
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c'}
[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I'm still on the Personal projects page. Let me scroll up to see the navigation tabs clearly and click on "Contributed projects".
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'keys': ['home']}
[result] Keys pressed successfully
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c'}
[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good, I can see the tabs clearly now. I'm currently on "Personal projects". Let me click on "Contributed projects" to verify what's there.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Contributed projects tab'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I'm on the "Contributed projects" tab. I can confirm there is only ONE project where I contributed:

**The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com** - ★ 21 stars

This project has 21 stars, NOT 0 stars.

So the answer is clear: There are NO repositories in the "Contributed projects" section that have 0 stars. The only repository I contributed to (where I'm not the owner) has 21 stars.

However, let me reconsider the interpretation. The task says "repositories where I made contributions and they got no stars". In GitLab/GitHub terminology:
- Making "contributions" typically means contributing code through commits, merge requests, etc.
- This can include both repositories you own AND repositories owned by others

Let me think about this differently. Perhaps the task wants me to consider ALL repositories where I made contributions (including my own personal projects where I'm the owner, since owners obviously contribute to their own projects).

In that case, from the "Personal projects" section, the repositories with 0 stars where I (as owner) made contributions are:

1. **Byte Blaze / dotfiles** - ★ 0
2. **Byte Blaze / timeit** - ★ 0
3. **Byte Blaze / solarized-prism-theme** - ★ 0
4. **Byte Blaze / gimmiethat.space** - ★ 0
5. **Byte Blaze / cloud-to-butt** - ★ 0
6. **Byte Blaze / remove-board-movement-events-from-the-github-issue-timeline** - ★ 0

Let me verify this is the complete list by checking the "Personal projects" section once more. Let me click on that tab.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Personal projects tab'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I'm back on the Personal projects tab. Now let me scroll down to see all the repositories with 0 stars and compile the complete list with their full names.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'keys': ['end']}
[result] Keys pressed successfully
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c'}
[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I can see the complete list. Let me compile all personal projects with 0 stars:

From the "Personal projects" section, the repositories with ★ 0 are:

1. **timeit** - ★ 0
2. **solarized-prism-theme** - ★ 0
3. **gimmiethat.space** - ★ 0
4. **cloud-to-butt** - ★ 0
5. **remove-board-movement-events-from-the-github-issue-timeline** - ★ 0

Let me scroll up to see if I missed any at the top of the list.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'keys': ['home']}
[result] Keys pressed successfully
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c'}
[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I can see from the top. Let me check if **dotfiles** also has 0 stars - yes, I can see:

**dotfiles** - ★ 0

So the complete list of personal projects with 0 stars is:

1. **dotfiles** - ★ 0
2. **timeit** - ★ 0
3. **solarized-prism-theme** - ★ 0
4. **gimmiethat.space** - ★ 0
5. **cloud-to-butt** - ★ 0
6. **remove-board-movement-events-from-the-github-issue-timeline** - ★ 0

Now, since the task asks for "repositories where I made contributions", I need to understand if this means:
1. Only repositories where I contributed but don't own (from "Contributed projects" tab) - in which case the answer would be "none" or empty
2. All repositories where I made contributions including ones I own - in which case it's the 6 repositories listed above

Given the phrasing "where I made contributions", I believe the most reasonable interpretation is ALL repositories where I contributed (including my own projects, since as an owner I obviously made contributions). 

However, I need to provide the FULL NAMES of the repositories. Let me check if I need to include the full path. Looking at the screen, I can see the projects are shown as just the repository name (like "dotfiles", "timeit", etc.) since they're all under "Byte Blaze".

But let me verify the full names by clicking on one repository to see its full name format.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'dotfiles repository link'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I see the URL at the bottom shows the path is being set to "/byteblaze/dotfiles". Let me wait for the page to load fully.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I can see the repository page. I can see:
- The breadcrumb shows: **Byte Blaze > dotfiles**
- The repository name at the top is: **dotfiles**
- It shows **0 Star** and **0 Fork**

So the full name format is "Byte Blaze / dotfiles". Let me go back to the personal projects page to compile the complete list with full names. Let me use the back button.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'keys': ['alt', 'arrowLeft']}
[result] Keys pressed successfully
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c'}
[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I'm back on the Personal projects page. Now let me scroll down to see all the repositories with 0 stars and compile the complete list with their full names.

From what I can see on the current screen with 0 stars:
1. **Byte Blaze / dotfiles** - ★ 0
2. **Byte Blaze / timeit** - ★ 0
3. **Byte Blaze / solarized-prism-theme** - ★ 0
4. **Byte Blaze / gimmiethat.space** - ★ 0
5. **Byte Blaze / cloud-to-butt** - ★ 0

Let me scroll down to see the remaining one.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'short'}
[result] Scrolled down by short distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I can see the 6th repository:

6. **Byte Blaze / remove-board-movement-events-from-the-github-issue-timeline** - ★ 0

So the complete list of repositories where I made contributions (as owner) and they have 0 stars:

1. Byte Blaze / dotfiles
2. Byte Blaze / timeit
3. Byte Blaze / solarized-prism-theme
4. Byte Blaze / gimmiethat.space
5. Byte Blaze / cloud-to-butt
6. Byte Blaze / remove-board-movement-events-from-the-github-issue-timeline

Now I need to provide the answer. The task asks for "full names of the repositories". Based on the format I saw, the full names include the owner/organization name followed by the repository name.
[tool] mcp__task-completion__complete_task: {'finalAnswer': 'Byte Blaze / dotfiles, Byte Blaze / timeit, Byte Blaze / solarized-prism-theme, Byte Blaze / gimmiethat.space, Byte Blaze / cloud-to-butt, Byte Blaze / remove-board-movement-events-from-the-github-issue-timeline'}

5. **Byte Blaze / cloud-to-butt**

I also need to scroll down to see all 14 projects to ensure I capture all repositories with 0 stars where I contributed. Let me scroll down to see more projects.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'direction\': \'down\', \'distance\': \'medium\'}\n[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood! I can see more projects now. Let me continue scrolling to see all remaining projects to make sure I capture all repositories with 0 stars.\n\nAdditional repositories with 0 stars that I can see:\n- **remove-board-movement-events-from-the-github-issue-timeline**: ★ 0\n- **solarized-prism-theme**: ★ 0\n- **timeit**: ★ 0\n\nLet me scroll down a bit more to see if there are any remaining projects.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'direction\': \'down\', \'distance\': \'medium\'}\n[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI can see the page hasn\'t changed much. Let me scroll back to the top to get a complete view of all projects and then check each repository to see if I made contributions to them.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'keys\': [\'home\']}\n[result] Keys pressed successfully\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\'}\n[result] {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood! Now I can see the list clearly. I need to check which repositories I made contributions to that have 0 stars. I can see the following repositories with 0 stars:\n\n- **Byte Blaze / cloud-to-butt** - ★ 0, Owner\n- **Byte Blaze / dotfiles** - ★ 0, Owner\n- **Byte Blaze / gimmiethat.space** - ★ 0, Owner\n\nHowever, I see labels like "Owner", "Maintainer", "Developer" which indicate my role. The task asks for repositories where I made **contributions**. Let me think about this:\n\n1. Being an "Owner" means I created/own the repository\n2. The task asks for repositories where I made "contributions"\n\nI need to check if there are more repositories below and also understand if "contributions" means I contributed to someone else\'s repository or if it includes repositories I own. Let me scroll down to see all 14 projects first to get the complete list.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'keys\': [\'end\']}\n[result] Keys pressed successfully\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\'}\n[result] {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect! Now I can see more repositories. Let me compile the complete list of repositories with 0 stars. I notice the task asks for repositories where "I made contributions" - this could mean either repositories I own/contribute to, or specifically repositories where I\'m a contributor (not owner). \n\nSince this is under the "Yours" tab (showing 14 projects), these are all repositories where I have some involvement. Let me check if I need to look at the contribution history to determine which ones I actually contributed to, or if the presence under "Yours" tab counts as contributions.\n\nLooking at the repositories with 0 stars visible on screen:\n- **Byte Blaze / cloud-to-butt** - ★ 0, Owner\n- **Byte Blaze / dotfiles** - ★ 0, Owner\n- **Byte Blaze / gimmiethat.space** - ★ 0, Owner\n- **Byte Blaze / remove-board-movement-events-from-the-github-issue-timeline** - ★ 0, Owner\n- **Byte Blaze / solarized-prism-theme** - ★ 0, Owner\n- **Byte Blaze / timeit** - ★ 0, Owner\n\nHowever, I also notice "Primer / design" which shows "Developer" role - this means I\'m a developer/contributor but not the owner. Let me check if there are any repositories where I\'m listed as a contributor/developer (not owner) that have 0 stars, as that might be what the task is asking for.\n\nLet me click on one of the repositories to check the contributions more carefully, or let me look for a way to see my actual contributions. Let me click on my profile or check if there\'s a contributions view.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'target\': \'user profile icon in the top right corner of the navigation bar\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood! A dropdown menu appeared. Let me click on "Byte Blaze" or "@byteblaze" to go to the profile page where I might see a contribution overview.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'target\': \'Byte Blaze username link in the dropdown menu\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI see the URL changed to the profile page but the content still shows the projects list. Let me wait for the page to load and take a screenshot.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'duration\': 2000}\n[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nExcellent! Now I\'m on the Byte Blaze profile page. I can see there are several tabs including "Contributed projects" which is exactly what I need. Let me click on that tab to see which projects I contributed to.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'target\': \'Contributed projects tab in the navigation menu\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect! I\'m now on the "Contributed projects" tab. I can see only ONE project where I made contributions:\n\n**The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com** - ★ 21, Maintainer\n\nThis project has 21 stars, NOT 0 stars. So this doesn\'t match the criteria.\n\nNow let me check the "Personal projects" tab to see all my personal projects and identify which ones have 0 stars. Let me click on that tab.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'target\': \'Personal projects tab in the navigation menu\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGreat! Now I\'m on the "Personal projects" tab. I can see several projects with 0 stars:\n\n1. **dotfiles** - ★ 0\n2. **timeit** - ★ 0\n3. **solarized-prism-theme** - ★ 0\n4. **gimmiethat.space** - ★ 0\n5. **cloud-to-butt** - ★ 0\n\nLet me scroll down to see if there are more projects with 0 stars.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'direction\': \'down\', \'distance\': \'medium\'}\n[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect! I can see more projects now. Let me identify the additional projects with 0 stars:\n\n6. **remove-board-movement-events-from-the-github-issue-timeline** - ★ 0\n\nNow let me understand the task better. The task asks for "repositories where I made contributions and they got no stars". \n\nLooking at the "Contributed projects" tab, I only contributed to **The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com** which has 21 stars, so that doesn\'t meet the criteria.\n\nHowever, the "Personal projects" are projects I own/created. The question is whether creating/owning a project counts as "making contributions" to it. In typical GitLab/GitHub terminology:\n- **Contributed projects** = projects where I contributed but don\'t own\n- **Personal projects** = projects I own/created\n\nSince I found NO repositories in the "Contributed projects" tab with 0 stars, and the only project there has 21 stars, let me verify if the task is asking about personal projects where I made contributions (as the owner/creator).\n\nLet me go back to check if there\'s another interpretation. Let me click on the "Contributed projects" tab again to make absolutely sure I didn\'t miss anything.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'target\': \'Contributed projects tab in the navigation menu\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI see a menu opened. Let me close this and try clicking on "Contributed projects" tab again.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'keys\': [\'escape\']}\n[result] Keys pressed successfully\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\'}\n[result] {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI\'m still on the Personal projects page. Let me scroll up to see the navigation tabs clearly and click on "Contributed projects".\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'keys\': [\'home\']}\n[result] Keys pressed successfully\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\'}\n[result] {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood, I can see the tabs clearly now. I\'m currently on "Personal projects". Let me click on "Contributed projects" to verify what\'s there.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'target\': \'Contributed projects tab\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect! Now I\'m on the "Contributed projects" tab. I can confirm there is only ONE project where I contributed:\n\n**The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com** - ★ 21 stars\n\nThis project has 21 stars, NOT 0 stars.\n\nSo the answer is clear: There are NO repositories in the "Contributed projects" section that have 0 stars. The only repository I contributed to (where I\'m not the owner) has 21 stars.\n\nHowever, let me reconsider the interpretation. The task says "repositories where I made contributions and they got no stars". In GitLab/GitHub terminology:\n- Making "contributions" typically means contributing code through commits, merge requests, etc.\n- This can include both repositories you own AND repositories owned by others\n\nLet me think about this differently. Perhaps the task wants me to consider ALL repositories where I made contributions (including my own personal projects where I\'m the owner, since owners obviously contribute to their own projects).\n\nIn that case, from the "Personal projects" section, the repositories with 0 stars where I (as owner) made contributions are:\n\n1. **Byte Blaze / dotfiles** - ★ 0\n2. **Byte Blaze / timeit** - ★ 0\n3. **Byte Blaze / solarized-prism-theme** - ★ 0\n4. **Byte Blaze / gimmiethat.space** - ★ 0\n5. **Byte Blaze / cloud-to-butt** - ★ 0\n6. **Byte Blaze / remove-board-movement-events-from-the-github-issue-timeline** - ★ 0\n\nLet me verify this is the complete list by checking the "Personal projects" section once more. Let me click on that tab.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'target\': \'Personal projects tab\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood! I\'m back on the Personal projects tab. Now let me scroll down to see all the repositories with 0 stars and compile the complete list with their full names.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'keys\': [\'end\']}\n[result] Keys pressed successfully\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\'}\n[result] {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect! Now I can see the complete list. Let me compile all personal projects with 0 stars:\n\nFrom the "Personal projects" section, the repositories with ★ 0 are:\n\n1. **timeit** - ★ 0\n2. **solarized-prism-theme** - ★ 0\n3. **gimmiethat.space** - ★ 0\n4. **cloud-to-butt** - ★ 0\n5. **remove-board-movement-events-from-the-github-issue-timeline** - ★ 0\n\nLet me scroll up to see if I missed any at the top of the list.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'keys\': [\'home\']}\n[result] Keys pressed successfully\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\'}\n[result] {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect! Now I can see from the top. Let me check if **dotfiles** also has 0 stars - yes, I can see:\n\n**dotfiles** - ★ 0\n\nSo the complete list of personal projects with 0 stars is:\n\n1. **dotfiles** - ★ 0\n2. **timeit** - ★ 0\n3. **solarized-prism-theme** - ★ 0\n4. **gimmiethat.space** - ★ 0\n5. **cloud-to-butt** - ★ 0\n6. **remove-board-movement-events-from-the-github-issue-timeline** - ★ 0\n\nNow, since the task asks for "repositories where I made contributions", I need to understand if this means:\n1. Only repositories where I contributed but don\'t own (from "Contributed projects" tab) - in which case the answer would be "none" or empty\n2. All repositories where I made contributions including ones I own - in which case it\'s the 6 repositories listed above\n\nGiven the phrasing "where I made contributions", I believe the most reasonable interpretation is ALL repositories where I contributed (including my own projects, since as an owner I obviously made contributions). \n\nHowever, I need to provide the FULL NAMES of the repositories. Let me check if I need to include the full path. Looking at the screen, I can see the projects are shown as just the repository name (like "dotfiles", "timeit", etc.) since they\'re all under "Byte Blaze".\n\nBut let me verify the full names by clicking on one repository to see its full name format.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'target\': \'dotfiles repository link\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI see the URL at the bottom shows the path is being set to "/byteblaze/dotfiles". Let me wait for the page to load fully.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'duration\': 2000}\n[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect! Now I can see the repository page. I can see:\n- The breadcrumb shows: **Byte Blaze > dotfiles**\n- The repository name at the top is: **dotfiles**\n- It shows **0 Star** and **0 Fork**\n\nSo the full name format is "Byte Blaze / dotfiles". Let me go back to the personal projects page to compile the complete list with full names. Let me use the back button.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'keys\': [\'alt\', \'arrowLeft\']}\n[result] Keys pressed successfully\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\'}\n[result] {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood! I\'m back on the Personal projects page. Now let me scroll down to see all the repositories with 0 stars and compile the complete list with their full names.\n\nFrom what I can see on the current screen with 0 stars:\n1. **Byte Blaze / dotfiles** - ★ 0\n2. **Byte Blaze / timeit** - ★ 0\n3. **Byte Blaze / solarized-prism-theme** - ★ 0\n4. **Byte Blaze / gimmiethat.space** - ★ 0\n5. **Byte Blaze / cloud-to-butt** - ★ 0\n\nLet me scroll down to see the remaining one.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'direction\': \'down\', \'distance\': \'short\'}\n[result] Scrolled down by short distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect! Now I can see the 6th repository:\n\n6. **Byte Blaze / remove-board-movement-events-from-the-github-issue-timeline** - ★ 0\n\nSo the complete list of repositories where I made contributions (as owner) and they have 0 stars:\n\n1. Byte Blaze / dotfiles\n2. Byte Blaze / timeit\n3. Byte Blaze / solarized-prism-theme\n4. Byte Blaze / gimmiethat.space\n5. Byte Blaze / cloud-to-butt\n6. Byte Blaze / remove-board-movement-events-from-the-github-issue-timeline\n\nNow I need to provide the answer. The task asks for "full names of the repositories".
