I can see I'm on the "One Stop Market" website, which appears to be a test e-commerce site. I need to search for the Amazon Echo Dot 3rd generation to find its customer reviews. Let me use the search bar.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Search bar with placeholder text "Search entire store here..."'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good, the search bar is now focused. Let me type "Amazon Echo Dot 3rd generation" to search for the product.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'content': 'Amazon Echo Dot 3rd generation', 'pressEnterAfterType': True}
[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the page is loading (there's a loading indicator in the tab). Let me wait for the search results to load.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Great! I can see search results for "Amazon Echo Dot 3rd generation". I can see several products related to Echo Dot on the page. I can see an "Echo Dot (3rd Gen) - Smart Speaker with Alexa" product on the right side of the screen. Let me click on it to view the product details and customer reviews.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Echo Dot (3rd Gen) - Smart Speaker with Alexa - Charcoal - Home Devices - Radio - WiFi - Bluetooth - Camera'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the page is loading. Let me wait for it to fully load before proceeding.

Perfect! I'm now on the Echo Dot (3rd Gen) product page. I can see the product title and that it says "Be the first to review this product", which indicates there are currently no customer reviews for this product. However, let me scroll down to check if there's a reviews section below that might contain reviews.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Great! I can see there are two tabs: "Details" and "Reviews". Let me click on the "Reviews" tab to see the customer reviews for this product.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Reviews tab'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the Reviews tab is now active, but it's showing a review submission form instead of existing reviews. This indicates that there are no customer reviews yet for this product - it's asking me to be the first to write a review. Let me scroll down to see if there are any existing reviews below this form.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see I've scrolled down and there are no customer reviews displayed - only the review submission form. The page shows that this product has no existing customer reviews yet. However, I notice at the bottom of the URL bar, there's a link that ends with "#reviews". Let me scroll up to check if I missed any reviews section, or let me try a different approach by searching for a different Echo Dot 3rd generation product that might have reviews.

Let me scroll back up to see the full page structure.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'long'}
[result] Scrolled up by long distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the product page clearly shows "Be the first to review this product" which confirms there are no existing customer reviews for this specific Echo Dot 3rd Gen product. Let me go back to the search results to see if there are other Echo Dot 3rd generation products that might have reviews.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'keys': ['alt', 'arrowLeft']}

[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I'm back at the search results page. I can see that the search returned "Items 1-12 of 31190" results. I can see an "iHome iAVS1 Bedside Stereo Speaker System for Amazon Echo Dot" with "12 Reviews" shown. Let me scroll down to see if there are more Echo Dot 3rd generation products with reviews.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see more products in the search results. Most of these are accessories for Echo Dot, not the Echo Dot itself. Let me try searching more specifically for "Echo Dot 3rd Gen" with quotes to get more precise results, or let me look at the search results more carefully. Let me scroll back up and try a new search with more specific terms.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'long'}
[result] Scrolled up by long distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I'm back at the top of the search results. I can see that most of the products shown are accessories for the Echo Dot, not the Echo Dot itself. Let me try a more specific search. Let me click on the search bar and search for just "Echo Dot" to see if that gives better results with the actual Echo Dot products that might have reviews.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Search bar at top of page'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Let me scroll up to find the search bar at the very top of the page.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled up by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I can see the search bar. I can see the current search is "Amazon Echo Dot 3rd gene" (truncated). Looking at the search results, I notice that the actual Echo Dot (3rd Gen) product that I viewed earlier had no reviews. However, I can see there are accessories with reviews. 

Based on my investigation, the Amazon Echo Dot 3rd generation product on this test e-commerce site has NO customer reviews yet. The product page clearly stated "Be the first to review this product."

Let me call complete_task with this finding:
