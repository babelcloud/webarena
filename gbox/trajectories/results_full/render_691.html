Good! I can see I'm on the "One Stop Market" e-commerce website. This is a Magento store with various product categories. Now I need to find the "Contact Us" page to draft an email to the shop owner requesting a coupon for a bulk purchase.

Let me scroll down to look for a "Contact Us" link, which is typically found in the footer of websites.

Perfect! I can see the footer section with a "Contact Us" link. Let me click on it to access the contact form.

- Name (pre-filled with "Emma Lopez")
- Email (pre-filled with "emma.lopez@gmail.com")
- Phone Number
- What's on your mind? (message field)

Now I need to draft an email in the "What's on your mind?" field requesting a coupon for a bulk purchase. Let me click on that text area and compose the message.

Perfect! I can see the email has been successfully typed into the "What's on your mind?" field. The text area is showing the end of the message with "hearing from you soon. Best regards, Emma Lopez".

According to the instructions (Rule 17), when asked to DRAFT a message/email, I should NOT submit or send it - I should just compose/write the draft and leave it in the compose window. The evaluator will assess the draft as-is.

Let me scroll up within the text area to verify the complete message is there, and then take a final screenshot to confirm the draft is complete.

Excellent! I can now see the beginning of the drafted email in the text area. The message starts with "Dear One Stop Market Team," and continues with "I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to inquire about the possibility of obtaining a discount coupon for a bulk..."

- A proper greeting
- The purpose of the inquiry (requesting a discount/coupon for bulk purchase)
- Details about planning to make a large quantity purchase
- A polite request for information about bulk discounts or coupon codes
- Professional closing with the sender's name
