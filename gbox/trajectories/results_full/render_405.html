Excellent! I'm now in the /r/DIY subreddit. I can see several posts with their submission dates. Looking at the posts, I need to identify the newest one. Let me check the dates:

1. "I made a makeup table for my girlfriend's birthday..." - submitted January 13, 2023 at 4:40 AM
2. "I DIY'd this bloody red leather purse for Halloween!" - submitted October 26, 2022 at 10:17 AM
3. "I made a honeycomb firewood rack" - submitted December 19, 2022 at 7:15 PM

The newest post appears to be the "[Meta] Hey there, mod of /r/Locksmith here..." post submitted on March 28, 2023 at 12:12 PM. However, I need to make sure these are sorted by "Hot" and check if there are newer posts. Let me scroll down to see if there are any more recent posts.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}

I can see these posts are all from "3 years ago", which means they're older than the posts I saw earlier. The posts are currently sorted by "Hot", which doesn't show the newest posts first. I need to sort by "New" to find the newest post. Let me scroll back up to access the sorting options.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled up by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I can see the sorting dropdown that says "Hot" with a dropdown arrow. I need to click on it to change the sorting to "New" so I can find the newest post.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'Hot dropdown button with down arrow next to Submissions and Comments tabs'}

Perfect! The dropdown menu is now open. I can see the sorting options:
- Hot (currently selected)
- New
- Active
- Top
- Controversial
- Most commented

I need to click on "New" to sort posts by newest first.
