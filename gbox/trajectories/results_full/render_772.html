I can see there are two tabs open. I need to switch to tab 2 which appears to be the Magento Admin with an edit review page already open. Let me switch to that tab and take a screenshot.

Perfect! I can see I'm currently on the Edit Review page for a review of "Circe Hooded Ice Fleece" and there's a confirmation dialog asking "Are you sure you want to do this?" with Cancel and OK buttons. This appears to be confirming the deletion of this review. 

I can see the review details:
- Product: Circe Hooded Ice Fleece
- Summary Rating: 1 star (negative)
- Status: Pending
- Summary of Review: "Bad!"
- Review: A detailed negative review mentioning disappointment with quality, fit issues, and poor functionality

This is clearly a negative review for a Circe fleece product that needs to be deleted. Let me click OK to confirm the deletion.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'OK button in the confirmation dialog'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! The confirmation dialog has been dismissed and I'm back to the Edit Review page. The page is still loading, so let me wait a moment and then check if the review was successfully deleted by going back to the pending reviews list.
[tool] TodoWrite: {'todos': [{'content': 'Check current tabs and take screenshot to see current state', 'status': 'completed', 'activeForm': 'Checked current tabs and took screenshot'}, {'content': 'Navigate to pending reviews section', 'status': 'completed', 'activeForm': 'Navigated to pending reviews section'}, {'content': 'Filter reviews for Circe fleece products', 'status': 'completed', 'activeForm': 'Filtered reviews for Circe fleece products'}, {'content': 'Delete the negative review for Circe Hooded Ice Fleece (ID 353)', 'status': 'completed', 'activeForm': 'Deleted the negative review for Circe Hooded Ice Fleece'}, {'content': 'Verify review deletion and check for any additional Circe fleece reviews', 'status': 'in_progress', 'activeForm': 'Verifying review deletion and checking for additional reviews'}]}

Excellent! I can see a success message "The review has been deleted" which confirms that the negative review for Circe Hooded Ice Fleece was successfully deleted.

Now I'm back on the Reviews page and I can see that:
1. There's "1 records found" showing 
2. I can see one remaining review (ID 352) which is for "Circe Hooded Ice Fleece" with status "Approved" and title "Good but not perfect"

I notice that the Product filter still has "Circe" in it, so this is showing all Circe reviews. The remaining review has a status of "Approved" and the title "Good but not perfect" which doesn't sound like a negative review. Let me check if this is indeed a positive/neutral review or if it might be negative too.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'Edit link in the Action column for review ID 352'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see this is a different review page - it looks like review ID 353 (not 352). I notice:
- Status: Pending
- Summary Rating: "Rating isn't Available" 
- Detailed Rating: 1 star (which is negative)
- The review text area appears to be empty or not loading properly

Let me scroll down to see if there's more content or go back to check the pending reviews more thoroughly. First, let me scroll down to see the full review content.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the review form more clearly now. This appears to be an empty review form - the fields for Nickname, Summary of Review, and Review are all empty. The status is "Pending" and it has a 1-star rating, but since all the content fields are empty, this might be a different type of issue.

Let me go back to check the pending reviews section more systematically to see if there are actually any other pending negative reviews for Circe fleece products.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'Back button in the top action bar'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Let me navigate back to the Pending Reviews list to check more thoroughly for any additional Circe fleece reviews. I'll use the navigation menu to get to the Pending Reviews section.

[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Great! I can see the Marketing menu is open and I can see "Pending Reviews" in the User Content section. Let me click on "Pending Reviews" to go back to the pending reviews list.

[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I'm now on the Pending Reviews page and I can see very important information:

- **"0 records found"** - This means there are NO pending reviews at all
- I can see that the Product filter still has "Circe" in it from our previous search
- The empty table confirms there are no pending reviews for Circe products

This is excellent news! The task was to "Delete all pending negative reviews for Circe fleece" and the results show:

1. I successfully deleted the negative review for "Circe Hooded Ice Fleece" (ID 353) which had a 1-star rating and negative content
2. Now there are "0 records found" for pending reviews with the Circe filter applied
3. This means there are no more pending negative reviews (or any pending reviews) for Circe fleece products

Let me also check without the filter to make sure there are truly no pending reviews for Circe fleece by clearing the filter and searching more broadly.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'Reset Filter link'}

Excellent! The page now shows "We couldn't find any records" and "0 records found" which confirms that there are absolutely NO pending reviews at all in the system. 

This means the task has been completed successfully:

1. ✅ I identified the negative review for "Circe Hooded Ice Fleece" (ID 353) with 1-star rating and negative content
2. ✅ I successfully deleted that review 
3. ✅ I verified that there are now no pending reviews for Circe fleece products specifically (0 records when filtered by "Circe")
4. ✅ I confirmed that there are no pending reviews at all in the system (0 records without any filters)
