Great! I can see I'm on the Magento Admin Dashboard. I can see the "Last Orders" section showing some customers and their order counts, but this appears to be recent orders only. I need to find a comprehensive view of all customers and their order history. Let me use the Magento Admin subagent to find where I can see customer order history.

Great! I'm now on the Order Total Report page. The report shows "We can't find records for this period" because no date range is set. I can see:
- From and To date fields (currently empty)
- "Show By" dropdown currently set to "Day"
- A table with columns: Interval, Customer, Orders, Average, Total

I need to set a broad date range to capture all historical orders. Let me click on the "Show By" dropdown and change it to "Year" as suggested by the subagent, which will make it easier to see cumulative totals.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Show By dropdown button with Day label'}

Good! "Year" is now selected. Now I need to click the "Refresh" button to load the data. Since I haven't set specific date ranges, it should show all available historical data.

The page still shows "We can't find records for this period." This suggests I need to set a specific date range. Let me set a broad date range to capture all historical data. I'll click on the "From" date field and enter a date far in the past.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'From date input field'}

Good! The page has loaded with dates. I can see:
- From: 9/29/25
- To: 10/29/25
- The table shows "2025" row with "We can't find records for this period."
- Total row shows 0 orders

The dates are currently set to recent dates in 2025. I need to change the "From" date to go back further in time to capture all historical orders. Let me clear the From field and enter an earlier date like 01/01/2020.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'From date input field with value 9/29/25'}

I can see the page is loading (notice the loading indicator in the tab). The To field also appears to be cleared now. The report still shows only 2025 with "We can't find records for this period." Let me wait for the page to finish loading and then take another screenshot.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'duration': 2000}

Excellent! Now I can see the data! The report is showing customer order counts for 2021. I can see various customers with their order counts in the "Orders" column:

- Jane Smith: 8 orders
- Grace Nguyen: 5 orders
- Jennifer White: 4 orders
- Lucy Garcia: 5 orders
- Ava Brown: 5 orders
- Samantha Jones: 4 orders
- Matt Baker: 5 orders
- Jason Miller: 4 orders
- Jane Doe: 5 orders
- Mary Martin: 4 orders
- John Smith: 5 orders
- Lily Potter: 3 orders
- Adam Garcia: 5 orders
- Michael Nguyen: 4 orders
- Alex Martin: 4 orders

I need to scroll down to see if there are more customers and find the one with exactly 2 orders. Let me scroll down to see more data.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I can now see several customers with exactly 2 orders:

1. **Katie Wong**: 2 orders
2. **Jane Snath**: 2 orders  
3. **Lisa Kim**: 2 orders
4. **Brian Smith**: 2 orders
5. **Alexander Thomas**: 2 orders

I can also see this is showing 2022 data at the top of the visible section. Let me continue scrolling to see if there are more customers with 2 orders and to make sure I have the complete picture across all years.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Great! I can see more data now. In this section, I can see more customers with exactly 2 orders:

- **John Smith**: 2 orders
- **Ava Brown**: 2 orders
- **Lily Potter**: 2 orders
- **Alex Martin**: 2 orders
- **Samantha Jones**: 2 orders
- **Bob Jones**: 2 orders
- **Adam Garcia**: 2 orders (in 2023)

I can also see we've reached the end - there's a "Total" row showing 166 total orders, and years 2024 and 2025 show "We can't find records for this period."

However, I notice this report is showing orders BY YEAR for each customer, not their total orders across all history. For example, I see "Jane Smith" appearing multiple times in different years. 

This means I need to look at the data differently. The issue is that this report breaks down orders by year for each customer, so a customer might have 2 orders in 2022 and 3 orders in 2021, giving them 5 total orders.

Let me try a different approach. Let me navigate to the Customers section directly where I can see the complete customer list with their total order counts. Let me use the Magento Admin subagent again to find where to see total order counts per customer across all time.
[tool] Task: {'subagent_type': 'magento-admin-guide', 'description': 'Find customer list view', 'prompt': 'Where can I see a complete list of all customers with their lifetime total order count (not broken down by year)? I need to find which customer has placed exactly 2 orders in their entire history.'}

[result] Based on the documentation, I found the answer. Let me provide you with the complete information:

**Location**: Reports > Customers > Order Total

**Description**: 
The Order Total Report shows custo
I see. The report is inherently time-based. However, looking back at the data I've already seen, I need to manually aggregate the order counts for each customer across all years to find who has exactly 2 orders total.

Let me scroll back to the top to systematically go through the data and tally up each customer's total orders across all years.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'keys': ['home']}

[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good, I'm back at the top. Now I need to carefully go through all the data and sum up each customer's orders across all years. Actually, let me try a better approach - I'll export this report to CSV and examine it more carefully. Let me click the "Export" button.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Export button'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Let me wait a moment to see if the export starts, then I'll manually go through the data I've already seen. Let me think about this differently - perhaps I should try looking at the "Customers > All Customers" section where I can see a customer grid and potentially filter or sort by order count.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'CUSTOMERS menu item in the left sidebar'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! The Customers menu is open. Let me click on "All Customers" to see the customer grid.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'All Customers option in the menu'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}

[result] Finished waiting for 3000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Great! Now I can see the Customers page with a grid showing all customers. I can see there are 70 records found. However, I don't see an "Orders" column in this view that would show the total order count per customer. 

Let me check if I can add a column to show order count. I'll click on the "Columns" dropdown to see what columns are available.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Columns button with dropdown icon'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! The Columns dropdown is open. I can see the available columns. Let me scroll down in this dropdown to see if there's an "Orders" or "Order Count" column available.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'short'}
[result] Scrolled down by short distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The columns dropdown closed and I scrolled the page. Let me click on the Columns button again to open it.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'short'}
[result] Scrolled up by short distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good, I'm back at the top. I can see there's no order count column visible in the customer grid. The subagent mentioned that I would need to click into each customer to see their order history. However, that would be very time-consuming with 70 customers.

Let me go back to the Order Total Report and manually analyze the data I saw. Based on what I observed when I scrolled through the report, I need to identify customers who appear with order counts that sum to exactly 2 across all years.

Let me navigate back to the Order Total Report.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'REPORTS menu item in the left sidebar'}

Perfect! The Reports menu is open. Let me click on "Order Total" under the Customers section.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Order Total under Customers section'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the URL changed to the report_customer/totals page. Let me close this menu and wait for the page to load.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'keys': ['escape']}

[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I'm back on the Order Total Report page, but it's reset to default settings (Day view, no date range). Based on my previous viewing of this report with the full date range, I noticed that the report shows customers' order counts broken down by year. Some customers appeared multiple times across different years.

Looking back at my screenshots, I saw customers who had exactly 2 orders in a single year. However, I need to identify which customer has EXACTLY 2 orders in their ENTIRE history (not per year).

Let me think about this differently. From what I observed:
- Many customers appeared with order counts in 2021, 2022, and 2023
- I saw several customers with 2 orders in specific years (Katie Wong, Jane Snath, Lisa Kim, Brian Smith, Alexander Thomas in 2022; John Smith, Ava Brown, Lily Potter, Alex Martin, Samantha Jones, Bob Jones in 2023, and Adam Garcia in 2023)

The key insight is: if a customer only appears ONCE in the entire report with an order count of 2, then they have exactly 2 orders total. But if they appear in multiple years, I need to sum their orders.

Let me try a different approach. Let me check the "Order Count" report instead, which might give me a clearer view.

Good! I'm now on the Order Count Report page. This appears to have the same structure as the Order Total Report - also time-based with intervals. Let me set it up with the broad date range and Year view like I did before. Let me click on the From date field.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'From date input field'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Let me think about this more carefully. Looking at the data I collected from the Order Total Report earlier, I need to manually analyze which customers have exactly 2 orders total across all years.

From my earlier screenshots, I noticed that:
- In 2022, I saw: Katie Wong (2), Jane Snath (2), Lisa Kim (2), Brian Smith (2), Alexander Thomas (2)
- In 2023, I saw: John Smith (2), Ava Brown (2), Lily Potter (2), Alex Martin (2), Samantha Jones (2), Bob Jones (2), Adam Garcia (2)

However, many customers appeared in MULTIPLE years. For example:
- In 2021, I saw Ava Brown (5) and Lily Potter (3)
- In 2023, I saw Ava Brown (2) and Lily Potter (2)

This means Ava Brown has 5+2=7 orders total, and Lily Potter has 3+2=5 orders total.

The key is to find customers who ONLY appear once in the entire report with exactly 2 orders, OR customers whose order counts across all years sum to exactly 2.

Let me navigate to the Sales > Orders section to see if I can get a better view of all orders and filter by customer.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'SALES menu item in the left sidebar'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! The Sales menu is open. Let me click on "Orders" to see all orders.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Orders option in the Sales menu'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the URL changed to sales/order/. Let me close the menu and wait for the orders page to load.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'keys': ['escape']}
[result] Keys pressed successfully
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'duration': 3000}
[result] Finished waiting for 3000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! I'm now on the Orders page showing all orders. I can see there are 308 records found. The table shows individual orders with Bill-to Name and Ship-to Name columns. 

I can see multiple orders from Veronica Costello and Sophie Taylor already visible. To find which customer has exactly 2 orders total, I could manually count orders per customer by looking at the Bill-to Name column. However, with 308 orders, this would be tedious.

Let me use the Filters feature to help organize this data. But actually, thinking about this more strategically - if I could group/count orders by customer name, that would be ideal. Let me check if there's a way to export or view a summary.

Actually, let me try a simpler approach. Looking back at my data from the Order Total Report, I need to find customers who only appeared ONCE across all years with exactly 2 orders. Let me carefully review my screenshots mentally:

From the Order Total Report (2022 section), customers with 2 orders who I saw were:
- Katie Wong: 2
- Jane Snath: 2  
- Lisa Kim: 2
- Brian Smith: 2
- Alexander Thomas: 2

Let me check if any of these appeared in other years. From my 2021 screenshot, I don't recall seeing these names. From my 2023 screenshot, I need to verify if any of these appeared there too.

Let me use the search function on this Orders page to count orders for one of these candidates. Let me search for "Katie Wong".
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Search by keyword input field'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'content': 'Katie Wong'}
[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good, I've typed "Katie Wong" in the search field. Now let me press Enter or click the search icon to search for her orders.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'keys': ['enter']}
[result] Keys pressed successfully
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I found Katie Wong's orders. The search shows "5 records found" for Katie Wong. I can see 5 orders:
1. Order 000000277 - Apr 3, 2023
2. Order 000000036 - Mar 12, 2022
3. Order 000000139 - Aug 28, 2022
4. Order 000000175 - Feb 13, 2022
5. Order 000000198 - Apr 30, 2022

So Katie Wong has **5 orders total**, not 2. The 2 orders I saw in the report must have been for a specific year only.

Let me try another candidate. Let me search for "Lisa Kim".
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Search by keyword input field with Katie Wong text'}

[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the search is loading (loading indicator visible). The search field shows "Lisa Kim" and "Active filters: Keyword: Lisa Kim". It still shows "5 records found" but the table is still showing Katie Wong's orders, which means it's still loading. Let me wait for the results.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'duration': 2000}

Interesting! Lisa Kim has "10 records found" - so she has 10 orders total, not 2. 

Let me try "Brian Smith" next.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Search by keyword input field with Lisa Kim text'}

[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see it's loading (loading indicator visible). The search field shows "Brian Smith" and it still shows "10 records found" with Lisa Kim's orders, meaning it's loading the new results. Let me wait.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Interesting! Brian Smith search returned "38 records found" but the Bill-to Name column shows "John Smith" - not "Brian Smith". It appears the keyword search matches multiple names. Brian Smith must have a lot of orders too.

Let me try "Alexander Thomas" next.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'keys': ['control', 'a']}

[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Great! Alexander Thomas has "10 records found" - so he also has 10 orders total, not 2.

Let me try "Jane Snath" - wait, I think I saw "Jane Snath" in my earlier screenshot. Let me search for that exact name.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'keys': ['control', 'a']}

[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the search is loading (loading indicator visible). Let me wait for the results.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The search returned "30 records found" but I see "Jane Smith" in the results, not "Jane Snath". This suggests the keyword search is matching partial names. This means there might not be a customer named "Jane Snath" - I may have misread the name in the report earlier.

Let me try a different approach. Let me search for "Samantha Nguyen" since I saw that name with 1 order in my earlier screenshot, and I want to find someone with exactly 2 orders.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'keys': ['control', 'a']}

[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see it's loading. Still showing "30 records found" with Jane Smith results, which means it's still processing. Let me wait.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! The search shows "45 records found" and I can see both "Samantha Nguyen" and "Samantha Jones" in the results. So Samantha Nguyen appears to have many orders (part of the 45 total).

Looking back at my earlier data from the Order Total Report, I recall seeing that Samantha Nguyen had 1 order in 2022. But this search shows she has multiple orders across different years.

Let me try searching for "Veronica Costello" since I saw her in the first Orders page with 2 orders visible.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'keys': ['control', 'a']}

[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! **Veronica Costello has exactly "2 records found"!**

I can see her two orders:
1. Order 000000001 - Mar 29, 2022 - $36.39 - Canceled
2. Order 000000002 - Apr 24, 2022 - $39.64 - Closed

This confirms that **Veronica Costello** is the customer who has placed exactly 2 orders in the entire history!

For example, I see "Jane Smith" appearing multiple times in different years. \n\nThis means I need to look at the data differently. The issue is that this report breaks down orders by year for each customer, so a customer might have 2 orders in 2022 and 3 orders in 2021, giving them 5 total orders.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Let me navigate to the Customers section directly where I can see the complete customer list with their total order counts.

However, looking back at the data I\'ve already seen, I need to manually aggregate the order counts for each customer across all years to find who has exactly 2 orders total.\n\nLet me scroll back to the top to systematically go through the data and tally up each customer\'s total orders across all years.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'keys\': [\'home\']}\n[result] Keys pressed successfully\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\'}\n[result] {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood, I\'m back at the top.

Let me think about this differently - perhaps I should try looking at the "Customers > All Customers" section where I can see a customer grid and potentially filter or sort by order count.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'target\': \'CUSTOMERS menu item in the left sidebar\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect!

I can see there\'s no order count column visible in the customer grid. The subagent mentioned that I would need to click into each customer to see their order history. However, that would be very time-consuming with 70 customers.\n\nLet me go back to the Order Total Report and manually analyze the data I saw. Based on what I observed when I scrolled through the report, I need to identify customers who appear with order counts that sum to exactly 2 across all years.\n\nLet me navigate back to the Order Total Report.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'target\': \'REPORTS menu item in the left sidebar\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect!

Based on my previous viewing of this report with the full date range, I noticed that the report shows customers\' order counts broken down by year. Some customers appeared multiple times across different years.\n\nLooking back at my screenshots, I saw customers who had exactly 2 orders in a single year. However, I need to identify which customer has EXACTLY 2 orders in their ENTIRE history (not per year).\n\nLet me think about this differently. From what I observed:\n- Many customers appeared with order counts in 2021, 2022, and 2023\n- I saw several customers with 2 orders in specific years (Katie Wong, Jane Snath, Lisa Kim, Brian Smith, Alexander Thomas in 2022; John Smith, Ava Brown, Lily Potter, Alex Martin, Samantha Jones, Bob Jones in 2023, and Adam Garcia in 2023)\n\nThe key insight is: if a customer only appears ONCE in the entire report with an order count of 2, then they have exactly 2 orders total. But if they appear in multiple years, I need to sum their orders.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Let me check the "Order Count" report instead, which might give me a clearer view.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'target\': \'REPORTS in the left sidebar\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood, the Reports menu is open.

I\'m now on the Order Count Report page. This appears to have the same structure as the Order Total Report - also time-based with intervals. Let me set it up with the broad date range and Year view like I did before. Let me click on the From date field.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'target\': \'From date input field\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nLet me think about this more carefully. Looking at the data I collected from the Order Total Report earlier, I need to manually analyze which customers have exactly 2 orders total across all years.\n\nFrom my earlier screenshots, I noticed that:\n- In 2022, I saw: Katie Wong (2), Jane Snath (2), Lisa Kim (2), Brian Smith (2), Alexander Thomas (2)\n- In 2023, I saw: John Smith (2), Ava Brown (2), Lily Potter (2), Alex Martin (2), Samantha Jones (2), Bob Jones (2), Adam Garcia (2)\n\nHowever, many customers appeared in MULTIPLE years. For example:\n- In 2021, I saw Ava Brown (5) and Lily Potter (3)\n- In 2023, I saw Ava Brown (2) and Lily Potter (2)\n\nThis means Ava Brown has 5+2=7 orders total, and Lily Potter has 3+2=5 orders total.\n\nThe key is to find customers who ONLY appear once in the entire report with exactly 2 orders, OR customers whose order counts across all years sum to exactly 2.\n\nLet me navigate to the Sales > Orders section to see if I can get a better view of all orders and filter by customer.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'target\': \'SALES menu item in the left sidebar\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect!

I\'m now on the Orders page showing all orders. I can see there are 308 records found. The table shows individual orders with Bill-to Name and Ship-to Name columns. \n\nI can see multiple orders from Veronica Costello and Sophie Taylor already visible. To find which customer has exactly 2 orders total, I could manually count orders per customer by looking at the Bill-to Name column. However, with 308 orders, this would be tedious.\n\nLet me use the Filters feature to help organize this data. But actually, thinking about this more strategically - if I could group/count orders by customer name, that would be ideal. Let me check if there\'s a way to export or view a summary.\n\nActually, let me try a simpler approach. Looking back at my data from the Order Total Report, I need to find customers who only appeared ONCE across all years with exactly 2 orders. Let me carefully review my screenshots mentally:\n\nFrom the Order Total Report (2022 section), customers with 2 orders who I saw were:\n- Katie Wong: 2\n- Jane Snath: 2  \n- Lisa Kim: 2\n- Brian Smith: 2\n- Alexander Thomas: 2\n\nLet me check if any of these appeared in other years. From my 2021 screenshot, I don\'t recall seeing these names. From my 2023 screenshot, I need to verify if any of these appeared there too.\n\nLet me use the search function on this Orders page to count orders for one of these candidates. Let me search for "Katie Wong".\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'target\': \'Search by keyword input field\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'content\': \'Katie Wong\'}\n[result] Text typed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood, I\'ve typed "Katie Wong" in the search field.

I found Katie Wong\'s orders. The search shows "5 records found" for Katie Wong. I can see 5 orders:\n1. Order 000000277 - Apr 3, 2023\n2. Order 000000036 - Mar 12, 2022\n3. Order 000000139 - Aug 28, 2022\n4. Order 000000175 - Feb 13, 2022\n5. Order 000000198 - Apr 30, 2022\n\nSo Katie Wong has **5 orders total**, not 2.

Let me wait for the results.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'duration\': 2000}\n[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nThe search returned "30 records found" but I see "Jane Smith" in the results, not "Jane Snath". This suggests the keyword search is matching partial names. This means there might not be a customer named "Jane Snath" - I may have misread the name in the report earlier.\n\nLet me try a different approach. Let me search for "Samantha Nguyen" since I saw that name with 1 order in my earlier screenshot, and I want to find someone with exactly 2 orders.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'keys\': [\'control\', \'a\']}\n[result] Keys pressed successfully\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'content\': \'Samantha Nguyen\', \'pressEnterAfterType\': True}\n[result] Text typed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI can see it\'s loading. Still showing "30 records found" with Jane Smith results, which means it\'s still processing. Let me wait.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'duration\': 2000}\n[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood! The search shows "45 records found" and I can see both "Samantha Nguyen" and "Samantha Jones" in the results. So Samantha Nguyen appears to have many orders (part of the 45 total).\n\nLooking back at my earlier data from the Order Total Report, I recall seeing that Samantha Nguyen had 1 order in 2022. But this search shows she has multiple orders across different years.\n\nLet me try searching for "Veronica Costello" since I saw her in the first Orders page with 2 orders visible.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'keys\': [\'control\', \'a\']}\n[result] Keys pressed successfully\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'content\': \'Veronica Costello\', \'pressEnterAfterType\': True}\n[result] Text typed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect! **Veronica Costello has exactly "2 records found"!**\n\nI can see her two orders:\n1. Order 000000001 - Mar 29, 2022 - $36.39 - Canceled\n2. Order 000000002 - Apr 24, 2022 - $39.64 - Closed\n\nThis confirms that **Veronica Costello** is the customer who has placed exactly 2 orders in the entire history!\n[tool] mcp__task-completion__complete_task: {\'finalAnswer\': \'Veronica Costello\'}\n[complete] Veronica Costello\nThe customer who has placed exactly 2 orders in the entire history is **Veronica Costello**.'}</pre></div><div class='parsed_action' style='background-color:yellow'><pre>stop [Veronica Costello]</pre></div></div>
