Good! I can see I'm on a GitLab dashboard showing various projects. I need to find my latest created issue that has "dependency" in its title. Let me look for a way to access my issues. I can see there's a navigation menu at the top. Let me click on the hamburger menu or look for an "Issues" section.

Let me click on the menu icon (three horizontal lines) to see navigation options.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'hamburger menu icon with three horizontal lines in the top left area of the GitLab interface'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The page looks the same. Let me look at the top navigation bar more carefully. I can see there are several icons in the top right area. I need to find a way to access "Issues". In GitLab, there's usually a way to see all issues across projects. Let me look for an "Issues" link in the top navigation area or check if there's a sidebar menu that opened.

Let me try clicking on the issue icon (looks like an exclamation mark in a circle) in the top navigation bar.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'icon in the top right navigation area that looks like a list or tasks icon, located between the notification bell and settings icons'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I see a "To-Do List" tooltip appeared. That's not what I need. Let me look for the Issues section. In GitLab, I should be able to access issues from the main navigation. Let me click directly on the GitLab logo or look for a menu with "Issues" option.

Let me try using the search bar at the top to search for issues, or I can look for the main menu. Let me click on the hamburger menu icon (three horizontal lines) in the top left corner.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'three horizontal lines menu icon in the dark purple navigation bar on the left side, next to the GitLab logo'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! Now I can see a sidebar menu opened with options including "Projects", "Groups", and under "Explore" there are "Milestones", "Snippets", and "Activity". I don't see "Issues" directly in this menu. Let me look for issues by clicking on "Activity" or by going back to check if there's an issues link elsewhere. 

Actually, let me try a different approach - I'll use the search bar at the top to search for my issues. Let me click on the search bar.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Search GitLab text input field in the top navigation bar'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I can see a dropdown menu with several options including:
- Issues assigned to me
- **Issues I've created** ← This is what I need!
- Merge requests assigned to me
- Merge requests that I'm a reviewer
- Merge requests I've created

Let me click on "Issues I've created" to see all the issues I've created.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': "Issues I've created option in the dropdown menu"}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I see the page is still showing the To-Do List and there's a loading indicator. Let me wait for the page to load completely.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! Now I can see the "Issues" page showing all the issues I've created. I can see several issues listed, and I need to find the latest created issue that has "dependency" or "dependencies" in its title.

Looking at the list, I can see:
- "add support for oh-my-zsh" - created 1 hour ago
- "Integrating LLMs for better prompts" - created 2 hours ago
- "401 bad gateway" - created 2 hours ago
- "[Feature suggestion] WCAG trash panda mode" - created 2 years ago
- "[Feature suggestion] Add a submission form" - created 2 years ago
- "[Feature suggestion] Color theme slider" - created 2 years ago
- **"Outdated dependencies"** - created 4 years ago ← This has "dependencies" in the title!
- "Better initial load experience" - created 8 years ago
- "Better sharing solution" - created 8 years ago
- "Create an Offline page" - created 5 years ago
- "Link to WCAG 2.1 instead of 2.0" - created 3 years ago

I can see "Outdated dependencies" which contains the word "dependencies" in its title. However, I need to check if this is the LATEST created issue with "dependency" in the title. Let me scroll down to see if there are more issues, or I should look at the creation dates more carefully.

Looking at the visible issues, "Outdated dependencies" was created 4 years ago. Let me scroll down to check if there are any more recent issues with "dependency" in the title.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I found another issue with "dependency" in the title:
- **"Remove Gulp as a dependency"** - created 5 years ago

So far, I've found two issues with "dependency/dependencies" in their titles:
1. "Outdated dependencies" - created 4 years ago
2. "Remove Gulp as a dependency" - created 5 years ago

Between these two, "Outdated dependencies" (created 4 years ago) is more recent than "Remove Gulp as a dependency" (created 5 years ago). However, I should check if there are more pages to see if there are any newer issues. I can see pagination at the bottom showing "1" and "2" and "Next >". Let me scroll back up to see the earlier issues again and verify which one is the latest.

Actually, wait - I need to reconsider the sorting. The page shows "Updated date" in the sort dropdown. Let me check what the current sort order is and whether I need to sort by creation date instead. Let me click on the sort dropdown to see the options.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled up by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good, I'm back at the top of the issues list. I can see the sort dropdown shows "Updated date" with a down arrow. Let me click on it to change the sort order to "Created date" so I can see the most recently created issues first.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Updated date dropdown button with down arrow on the right side of the issues list'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I can see a dropdown menu with sort options:
- Priority
- Created date
- Closed date
- Updated date (currently selected with a checkmark)
- Milestone due date
- Due date
- Popularity
- Label priority
- Manual
- Title

Let me click on "Created date" to sort by creation date.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Created date option in the sort dropdown menu'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! Now the sort is set to "Created date" (I can see "Created date" in the dropdown button). The list is now sorted by creation date. Looking at the issues shown:

1. "add support for oh-my-zsh" - created 1 hour ago (most recent)
2. "Integrating LLMs for better prompts" - created 2 hours ago
3. "401 bad gateway" - created 2 hours ago
4. "[Feature suggestion] WCAG trash panda mode" - created 2 years ago
5. "[Feature suggestion] Add a submission form" - created 2 years ago
6. "[Feature suggestion] Color theme slider" - created 2 years ago
7. **"Outdated dependencies"** - created 4 years ago ← This has "dependencies" in the title!

The most recent issue with "dependency" in the title that I can see so far is "Outdated dependencies" created 4 years ago. However, I need to check if the sorting is descending (newest first) or ascending (oldest first). Looking at the order, it appears to be descending (newest first: 1 hour ago, then 2 hours ago, then 2 years ago, then 4 years ago).

But I should verify by looking at all issues to make sure there isn't a more recent one with "dependency" in the title. Let me search or filter specifically for issues with "dependency" in the title. Let me use the search functionality to filter for "dependency".

Let me type "dependency" in the search area to filter the issues.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Search GitLab text input field in the top purple navigation bar'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I see the search dropdown appeared but I also notice the page has scrolled and I can now see "Outdated dependencies" at the bottom of the visible area. Let me close this search dropdown and instead use a better approach - I'll use the filter/search functionality directly on the issues page. Let me press Escape to close this dropdown first.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'keys': ['escape']}
[result] Keys pressed successfully
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c'}
[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I can see the issues list and at the bottom I can see "Outdated dependencies". Now let me search for issues with "dependency" in the title by using Ctrl+F to search on the page, or better yet, let me add a search filter. I'll look for a search or filter box. 

Actually, I realize I should use the GitLab search functionality more efficiently. Let me look at the URL - it shows I'm viewing issues filtered by author (Byte Blaze) and sorted by created_date. I can add a search parameter to filter by title. Let me try using the search/filter area on the page itself.

However, looking at the current list sorted by creation date (newest first), and seeing:
- Recent issues from 1-4 hours ago
- Then issues from 2-3 years ago  
- Then "Outdated dependencies" created 4 years ago

Let me scroll through all the pages to find all issues with "dependency" in the title and identify which one was created most recently. But first, let me use a more efficient approach - I'll use the browser's find function to search for "dependen" on this page.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'keys': ['control', 'f']}
[result] Keys pressed successfully
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c'}
[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I can see a find/search box appeared in the top right corner of the browser. Now let me type "dependen" to search for issues with "dependency" or "dependencies" in their title.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'content': 'dependen'}
[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! The search found matches and shows "1/2" in the search box, meaning there are 2 matches for "dependen" on this page. I can see "Outdated dependencies" is highlighted at the bottom with the word "dependen" highlighted in orange. 

The search shows "1/2", which means this is the first match. Let me click the down arrow or press Enter to go to the next match to see if there's another issue with "dependency" in the title on this page.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'keys': ['enter']}
[result] Keys pressed successfully
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c'}
[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I can see the search moved to "2/2", showing the second match. I can see two issues with "dependency" in their titles on this page:

1. **"Outdated dependencies"** - created 4 years ago (visible on screen with "dependen" highlighted)
2. **"Remove Gulp as a dependency"** - created 5 years ago (visible on screen with "dependen" highlighted in orange)

Since the page is sorted by "Created date" in descending order (newest first), and I can see these are on page 1, let me check if there are any issues with "dependency" on page 2. Let me close the search first and navigate to page 2 to make sure I haven't missed any.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'keys': ['escape']}
[result] Keys pressed successfully
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'page number 2 button at the bottom pagination area'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I notice the URL changed to show "page=2" but the page content looks the same. I can still see both "Outdated dependencies" and "Remove Gulp as a dependency" on the screen. Let me wait for the page to load properly.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! Now I'm on page 2 and I can see only 2 issues:
- "Better initial load experience" - created 8 years ago
- "Better sharing solution" - created 8 years ago

Neither of these has "dependency" in the title. So I've confirmed that among all my created issues, the ones with "dependency" in the title are:

1. **"Outdated dependencies"** - created 4 years ago (LATEST)
2. **"Remove Gulp as a dependency"** - created 5 years ago

The latest created issue with "dependency" in its title is **"Outdated dependencies"** created 4 years ago. Now I need to open this issue and check if it is closed. Let me go back to page 1 and click on it.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'page number 1 button in the pagination area'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I'm still on page 2. Let me scroll up to see if page 1 content loaded, or let me click the "Prev" button to go back.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Prev button in the pagination area'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I'm back on page 1. Now I need to scroll down to find the "Outdated dependencies" issue and click on it to check if it's closed.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'short'}
[result] Scrolled down by short distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Interesting! I seem to have navigated to a specific issue page. I can see:
- The title shows "Investigate if <details>/<summary> is a good choice for our Checklist"
- The status shows "Open" (green badge at the top)
- On the right sidebar, I can see labels: "bug" and "help wanted"

But this is not the "Outdated dependencies" issue I need to check. Let me go back to the issues list. Let me click on "Issues" in the left sidebar or use the browser back button.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Issues menu item in the left sidebar showing 41 count'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the "Issues" menu item is now highlighted in the left sidebar, but the page is still showing this specific issue. Let me click on "List" which is under the Issues section to go back to the issues list view.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'List menu item under Issues in the left sidebar'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! Now I'm on a different issues list view. I can see this is showing issues for "The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com" project. I can see at the top it shows:
- Open: 41
- Closed: 570
- All: 611

And the sort dropdown shows "Created date". However, this looks like it's showing all issues for this specific project, not just the ones I created. I need to go back to my personal "Issues I've created" view. Let me use the search bar at the top to navigate back to that view.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Search GitLab input field in the top purple navigation bar'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! The dropdown appeared again. Let me click on "Issues I've created" to go back to my personal issues list.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': "Issues I've created option in the dropdown menu"}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I see a different dropdown menu appeared showing repository navigation options (Files, Commits, Branches, Tags, Contributors, Graph, Compare). This is not what I need. Let me press Escape to close this and try a different approach. I'll navigate directly using the URL or search for the "Outdated dependencies" issue using the search box on this page.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'keys': ['escape']}
[result] Keys pressed successfully
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c'}
[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I can see the filtered list showing issues created by Byte Blaze (me). I can see the URL shows "author_username=byteblaze" and the filter shows "Author = Byte Blaze". 

Looking at the list, I can see:
- "401 bad gateway" - created 2 hours ago
- "Link to WCAG 2.1 instead of 2.0?" - created 3 years ago
- "Investigate if <details>/<summary> is a good choice for our Checklist" - created 3 years ago
- "The process for writing for us is both scattered and buried" - created 4 years ago
- "Our non-GitHub editorial process is opaque" - created 4 years ago
- "Non-Github contribution guidelines need clarification" - created 4 years ago
- "Articles wanted: auditing the accessibility of iOS and Android mobile apps" - created 5 years ago
- "Create an Offline page" - created 5 years ago
- **"Remove Gulp as a dependency"** - created 5 years ago (I can see this one with "dependency" in the title!)

Let me scroll down to see if there's "Outdated dependencies" which should have been created 4 years ago.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled up by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I'm seeing the same list. The issues I can see with creation dates around 4 years ago are:
- "The process for writing for us is both scattered and buried" - created 4 years ago
- "Our non-GitHub editorial process is opaque" - created 4 years ago  
- "Non-Github contribution guidelines need clarification" - created 4 years ago

I notice that when I searched earlier on the dashboard view, I found "Outdated dependencies" created 4 years ago. But I'm not seeing it in this current view. Let me use Ctrl+F to search for "Outdated" on this page to confirm.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'keys': ['control', 'f']}
[result] Keys pressed successfully
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'content': 'Outdated'}
[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The search shows "0/0" which means "Outdated" is not found on this current page. This suggests that "Outdated dependencies" might be on a different page, or it might be in a different project. Let me close this search and check if I need to look at the "Closed" issues tab instead, since I'm currently on the "Open" tab.

Let me close the search first.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'keys': ['escape']}
[result] Keys pressed successfully
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c'}
[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I notice at the top there are tabs:
- **Open** (14) - currently selected
- **Closed** (50)
- **All** (64)

The "Outdated dependencies" issue might be in the "Closed" tab since I didn't find it in the "Open" issues. Also, when I saw it earlier on the dashboard, it had labels indicating it might be closed. Let me click on the "Closed" tab to check.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Closed tab showing 50 closed issues'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I can see the "Closed" tab is now active (showing 50 closed issues). The page is loading - I can see gray placeholder bars indicating the content is being loaded. Let me wait for it to finish loading.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! Now I can see the closed issues list. All issues shown have "CLOSED" status on the right side. Let me search for "Outdated" or "dependency" in this list. I can see several closed issues but I need to look for ones with "dependency" in the title. Let me use Ctrl+F to search.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'keys': ['control', 'f']}
[result] Keys pressed successfully
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'content': 'dependen'}
[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The search shows "0/0" again, which means "dependen" is not found on this visible portion of the closed issues page. The issue might be on another page. Let me close the search and scroll down to see more closed issues, or check if "Outdated dependencies" is in a different project (not "The A11Y Project").

Let me close the search and think about this differently. When I was on the dashboard earlier, I saw "Outdated dependencies" in the "byteblaze/empathy-prompts" project. Let me navigate back to the global dashboard view to find it.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'keys': ['escape']}
[result] Keys pressed successfully
Let me navigate to the dashboard to see all my issues across all projects. I'll type the dashboard URL directly or use the navigation.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'GitLab logo icon in the top left corner of the navigation bar'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The URL changed to just the base GitLab URL. Let me now use the search function to navigate to "Issues I've created" across all projects.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Search GitLab input field in the top purple navigation bar'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I can see the dropdown menu and I can also see the Projects dashboard in the background. I can see "Byte Blaze / empathy-prompts" project in the list. Let me click on "Issues I've created" to go to the global issues view.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': "Issues I've created option in the dropdown menu"}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I'm still on the Projects page. The URL shows "dashboard/issues?author_username=byteblaze" but the page is showing the Projects list. Let me wait for it to load or refresh.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! Now I'm back on the global Issues dashboard showing all issues I've created across all projects. I can see at the bottom of the visible list:

**"Outdated dependencies"** 

This is the issue with "dependency" in the title! Now I need to click on it to open it and check if it's closed. Let me click on this issue.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Outdated dependencies issue title link at the bottom of the issues list'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the URL changed to "byteblaze/empathy-prompts/-/issues/18" and the tab title shows "Outdated dependencies (#..." but the page is still showing the issues list. Let me wait for the individual issue page to load.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I have successfully opened the "Outdated dependencies" issue. Now I can see the issue details clearly:

**Title:** Outdated dependencies
**Status:** There's a green badge that says "Open" at the top left (near the title)
**Description:** "The version of Gulp I use is no longer supported. I'll need to replatform this before any more issues can be addressed."
**Created:** 4 years ago by Byte Blaze
**Labels:** [Priority] Critical, [Status] Submitted, [Type] Bug

The issue status is **OPEN** (indicated by the green "Open" badge).

Since the task asks me to check if the latest created issue with "dependency" in its title is closed, and I've found that "Outdated dependencies" (created 4 years ago) is the latest such issue, and it is **OPEN** (not closed), I can now complete the task.
[tool] mcp__task-completion__complete_task: {'finalAnswer': 'No'}
[complete] No
The task is complete! I found my latest created issue with "dependency" in its title, which is "Outdated dependencies" (created 4 years ago), and confirmed that it is **NOT closed** - it has an "Open" status.</pre></div><div class='action_object' style='background-color:grey'><pre>{'action_type': <ActionTypes.STOP: 17>, 'coords': array([0., 0.], dtype=float32), 'element_role': 0, 'element_name': '', 'text': [], 'page_number': 0, 'url': '', 'nth': 0, 'pw_code': '', 'element_id': '', 'key_comb': '', 'direction': '', 'answer': 'No', 'raw_prediction': 'I\'ll help you find and check your latest created issue with "dependency" in its title.

Now I can see the "Issues" page showing all the issues I\'ve created. I can see several issues listed, and I need to find the latest created issue that has "dependency" or "dependencies" in its title.\n\nLooking at the list, I can see:\n- "add support for oh-my-zsh" - created 1 hour ago\n- "Integrating LLMs for better prompts" - created 2 hours ago\n- "401 bad gateway" - created 2 hours ago\n- "[Feature suggestion] WCAG trash panda mode" - created 2 years ago\n- "[Feature suggestion] Add a submission form" - created 2 years ago\n- "[Feature suggestion] Color theme slider" - created 2 years ago\n- **"Outdated dependencies"** - created 4 years ago ← This has "dependencies" in the title!\n- "Better initial load experience" - created 8 years ago\n- "Better sharing solution" - created 8 years ago\n- "Create an Offline page" - created 5 years ago\n- "Link to WCAG 2.1 instead of 2.0" - created 3 years ago\n\nI can see "Outdated dependencies" which contains the word "dependencies" in its title. However, I need to check if this is the LATEST created issue with "dependency" in the title. Let me scroll down to see if there are more issues, or I should look at the creation dates more carefully.\n\nLooking at the visible issues, "Outdated dependencies" was created 4 years ago. Let me scroll down to check if there are any more recent issues with "dependency" in the title.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'direction\': \'down\', \'distance\': \'medium\'}\n[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect! I found another issue with "dependency" in the title:\n- **"Remove Gulp as a dependency"** - created 5 years ago\n\nSo far, I\'ve found two issues with "dependency/dependencies" in their titles:\n1. "Outdated dependencies" - created 4 years ago\n2. "Remove Gulp as a dependency" - created 5 years ago\n\nBetween these two, "Outdated dependencies" (created 4 years ago) is more recent than "Remove Gulp as a dependency" (created 5 years ago). However, I should check if there are more pages to see if there are any newer issues. I can see pagination at the bottom showing "1" and "2" and "Next >". Let me scroll back up to see the earlier issues again and verify which one is the latest.\n\nActually, wait - I need to reconsider the sorting. The page shows "Updated date" in the sort dropdown. Let me check what the current sort order is and whether I need to sort by creation date instead. Let me click on the sort dropdown to see the options.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'direction\': \'up\', \'distance\': \'medium\'}\n[result] Scrolled up by medium distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood, I\'m back at the top of the issues list. I can see the sort dropdown shows "Updated date" with a down arrow. Let me click on it to change the sort order to "Created date" so I can see the most recently created issues first.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'target\': \'Updated date dropdown button with down arrow on the right side of the issues list\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect! I can see a dropdown menu with sort options:\n- Priority\n- Created date\n- Closed date\n- Updated date (currently selected with a checkmark)\n- Milestone due date\n- Due date\n- Popularity\n- Label priority\n- Manual\n- Title\n\nLet me click on "Created date" to sort by creation date.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'target\': \'Created date option in the sort dropdown menu\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood! Now the sort is set to "Created date" (I can see "Created date" in the dropdown button). The list is now sorted by creation date. Looking at the issues shown:\n\n1. "add support for oh-my-zsh" - created 1 hour ago (most recent)\n2. "Integrating LLMs for better prompts" - created 2 hours ago\n3. "401 bad gateway" - created 2 hours ago\n4. "[Feature suggestion] WCAG trash panda mode" - created 2 years ago\n5. "[Feature suggestion] Add a submission form" - created 2 years ago\n6. "[Feature suggestion] Color theme slider" - created 2 years ago\n7. **"Outdated dependencies"** - created 4 years ago ← This has "dependencies" in the title!\n\nThe most recent issue with "dependency" in the title that I can see so far is "Outdated dependencies" created 4 years ago. However, I need to check if the sorting is descending (newest first) or ascending (oldest first). Looking at the order, it appears to be descending (newest first: 1 hour ago, then 2 hours ago, then 2 years ago, then 4 years ago).\n\nBut I should verify by looking at all issues to make sure there isn\'t a more recent one with "dependency" in the title. Let me search or filter specifically for issues with "dependency" in the title. Let me use the search functionality to filter for "dependency".\n\nLet me type "dependency" in the search area to filter the issues.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'target\': \'Search GitLab text input field in the top purple navigation bar\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI see the search dropdown appeared but I also notice the page has scrolled and I can now see "Outdated dependencies" at the bottom of the visible area. Let me close this search dropdown and instead use a better approach - I\'ll use the filter/search functionality directly on the issues page. Let me press Escape to close this dropdown first.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'keys\': [\'escape\']}\n[result] Keys pressed successfully\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\'}\n[result] {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood! I can see the issues list and at the bottom I can see "Outdated dependencies". Now let me search for issues with "dependency" in the title by using Ctrl+F to search on the page, or better yet, let me add a search filter. I\'ll look for a search or filter box. \n\nActually, I realize I should use the GitLab search functionality more efficiently. Let me look at the URL - it shows I\'m viewing issues filtered by author (Byte Blaze) and sorted by created_date. I can add a search parameter to filter by title. Let me try using the search/filter area on the page itself.\n\nHowever, looking at the current list sorted by creation date (newest first), and seeing:\n- Recent issues from 1-4 hours ago\n- Then issues from 2-3 years ago  \n- Then "Outdated dependencies" created 4 years ago\n\nLet me scroll through all the pages to find all issues with "dependency" in the title and identify which one was created most recently. But first, let me use a more efficient approach - I\'ll use the browser\'s find function to search for "dependen" on this page.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'keys\': [\'control\', \'f\']}\n[result] Keys pressed successfully\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\'}\n[result] {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect! I can see a find/search box appeared in the top right corner of the browser. Now let me type "dependen" to search for issues with "dependency" or "dependencies" in their title.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'content\': \'dependen\'}\n[result] Text typed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nExcellent! The search found matches and shows "1/2" in the search box, meaning there are 2 matches for "dependen" on this page. I can see "Outdated dependencies" is highlighted at the bottom with the word "dependen" highlighted in orange. \n\nThe search shows "1/2", which means this is the first match. Let me click the down arrow or press Enter to go to the next match to see if there\'s another issue with "dependency" in the title on this page.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'keys\': [\'enter\']}\n[result] Keys pressed successfully\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\'}\n[result] {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect! Now I can see the search moved to "2/2", showing the second match. I can see two issues with "dependency" in their titles on this page:\n\n1. **"Outdated dependencies"** - created 4 years ago (visible on screen with "dependen" highlighted)\n2. **"Remove Gulp as a dependency"** - created 5 years ago (visible on screen with "dependen" highlighted in orange)\n\nSince the page is sorted by "Created date" in descending order (newest first), and I can see these are on page 1, let me check if there are any issues with "dependency" on page 2. Let me close the search first and navigate to page 2 to make sure I haven\'t missed any.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'keys\': [\'escape\']}\n[result] Keys pressed successfully\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'target\': \'page number 2 button at the bottom pagination area\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI notice the URL changed to show "page=2" but the page content looks the same.

Now I\'m on page 2 and I can see only 2 issues:\n- "Better initial load experience" - created 8 years ago\n- "Better sharing solution" - created 8 years ago\n\nNeither of these has "dependency" in the title. So I\'ve confirmed that among all my created issues, the ones with "dependency" in the title are:\n\n1. **"Outdated dependencies"** - created 4 years ago (LATEST)\n2. **"Remove Gulp as a dependency"** - created 5 years ago\n\nThe latest created issue with "dependency" in its title is **"Outdated dependencies"** created 4 years ago. Now I need to open this issue and check if it is closed. Let me go back to page 1 and click on it.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'target\': \'page number 1 button in the pagination area\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI\'m still on page 2. Let me scroll up to see if page 1 content loaded, or let me click the "Prev" button to go back.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'target\': \'Prev button in the pagination area\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect! I\'m back on page 1. Now I need to scroll down to find the "Outdated dependencies" issue and click on it to check if it\'s closed.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'direction\': \'down\', \'distance\': \'short\'}\n[result] Scrolled down by short distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nInteresting! I seem to have navigated to a specific issue page. I can see:\n- The title shows "Investigate if <details>/<summary> is a good choice for our Checklist"\n- The status shows "Open" (green badge at the top)\n- On the right sidebar, I can see labels: "bug" and "help wanted"\n\nBut this is not the "Outdated dependencies" issue I need to check. Let me go back to the issues list. Let me click on "Issues" in the left sidebar or use the browser back button.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'target\': \'Issues menu item in the left sidebar showing 41 count\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI can see the "Issues" menu item is now highlighted in the left sidebar, but the page is still showing this specific issue. Let me click on "List" which is under the Issues section to go back to the issues list view.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'target\': \'List menu item under Issues in the left sidebar\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood! Now I\'m on a different issues list view. I can see this is showing issues for "The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com" project. I can see at the top it shows:\n- Open: 41\n- Closed: 570\n- All: 611\n\nAnd the sort dropdown shows "Created date". However, this looks like it\'s showing all issues for this specific project, not just the ones I created. I need to go back to my personal "Issues I\'ve created" view. Let me use the search bar at the top to navigate back to that view.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'target\': \'Search GitLab input field in the top purple navigation bar\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect! The dropdown appeared again. Let me click on "Issues I\'ve created" to go back to my personal issues list.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'target\': "Issues I\'ve created option in the dropdown menu"}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI see a different dropdown menu appeared showing repository navigation options (Files, Commits, Branches, Tags, Contributors, Graph, Compare). This is not what I need. Let me press Escape to close this and try a different approach. I\'ll navigate directly using the URL or search for the "Outdated dependencies" issue using the search box on this page.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'keys\': [\'escape\']}\n[result] Keys pressed successfully\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\'}\n[result] {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect! Now I can see the filtered list showing issues created by Byte Blaze (me). I can see the URL shows "author_username=byteblaze" and the filter shows "Author = Byte Blaze". \n\nLooking at the list, I can see:\n- "401 bad gateway" - created 2 hours ago\n- "Link to WCAG 2.1 instead of 2.0?" - created 3 years ago\n- "Investigate if <details>/<summary> is a good choice for our Checklist" - created 3 years ago\n- "The process for writing for us is both scattered and buried" - created 4 years ago\n- "Our non-GitHub editorial process is opaque" - created 4 years ago\n- "Non-Github contribution guidelines need clarification" - created 4 years ago\n- "Articles wanted: auditing the accessibility of iOS and Android mobile apps" - created 5 years ago\n- "Create an Offline page" - created 5 years ago\n- **"Remove Gulp as a dependency"** - created 5 years ago (I can see this one with "dependency" in the title!)\n\nLet me scroll down to see if there\'s "Outdated dependencies" which should have been created 4 years ago.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'direction\': \'up\', \'distance\': \'medium\'}\n[result] Scrolled up by medium distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI\'m seeing the same list. The issues I can see with creation dates around 4 years ago are:\n- "The process for writing for us is both scattered and buried" - created 4 years ago\n- "Our non-GitHub editorial process is opaque" - created 4 years ago  \n- "Non-Github contribution guidelines need clarification" - created 4 years ago\n\nI notice that when I searched earlier on the dashboard view, I found "Outdated dependencies" created 4 years ago. But I\'m not seeing it in this current view. Let me use Ctrl+F to search for "Outdated" on this page to confirm.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'keys\': [\'control\', \'f\']}\n[result] Keys pressed successfully\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'content\': \'Outdated\'}\n[result] Text typed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nThe search shows "0/0" which means "Outdated" is not found on this current page. This suggests that "Outdated dependencies" might be on a different page, or it might be in a different project. Let me close this search and check if I need to look at the "Closed" issues tab instead, since I\'m currently on the "Open" tab.\n\nLet me close the search first.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'keys\': [\'escape\']}\n[result] Keys pressed successfully\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\'}\n[result] {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI notice at the top there are tabs:\n- **Open** (14) - currently selected\n- **Closed** (50)\n- **All** (64)\n\nThe "Outdated dependencies" issue might be in the "Closed" tab since I didn\'t find it in the "Open" issues. Also, when I saw it earlier on the dashboard, it had labels indicating it might be closed. Let me click on the "Closed" tab to check.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'target\': \'Closed tab showing 50 closed issues\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood! I can see the "Closed" tab is now active (showing 50 closed issues). The page is loading - I can see gray placeholder bars indicating the content is being loaded. Let me wait for it to finish loading.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'duration\': 2000}\n[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nExcellent! Now I can see the closed issues list. All issues shown have "CLOSED" status on the right side. Let me search for "Outdated" or "dependency" in this list. I can see several closed issues but I need to look for ones with "dependency" in the title. Let me use Ctrl+F to search.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'keys\': [\'control\', \'f\']}\n[result] Keys pressed successfully\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'content\': \'dependen\'}\n[result] Text typed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nThe search shows "0/0" again, which means "dependen" is not found on this visible portion of the closed issues page. The issue might be on another page. Let me close the search and scroll down to see more closed issues, or check if "Outdated dependencies" is in a different project (not "The A11Y Project").\n\nLet me close the search and think about this differently. When I was on the dashboard earlier, I saw "Outdated dependencies" in the "byteblaze/empathy-prompts" project. Let me navigate back to the global dashboard view to find it.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'keys\': [\'escape\']}\n[result] Keys pressed successfully\nLet me navigate to the dashboard to see all my issues across all projects. I\'ll type the dashboard URL directly or use the navigation.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'target\': \'GitLab logo icon in the top left corner of the navigation bar\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nThe URL changed to just the base GitLab URL. Let me now use the search function to navigate to "Issues I\'ve created" across all projects.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'target\': \'Search GitLab input field in the top purple navigation bar\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect! I can see the dropdown menu and I can also see the Projects dashboard in the background. I can see "Byte Blaze / empathy-prompts" project in the list. Let me click on "Issues I\'ve created" to go to the global issues view.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'target\': "Issues I\'ve created option in the dropdown menu"}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI\'m still on the Projects page. The URL shows "dashboard/issues?author_username=byteblaze" but the page is showing the Projects list. Let me wait for it to load or refresh.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'duration\': 2000}\n[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nExcellent! Now I\'m back on the global Issues dashboard showing all issues I\'ve created across all projects. I can see at the bottom of the visible list:\n\n**"Outdated dependencies"** \n\nThis is the issue with "dependency" in the title! Now I need to click on it to open it and check if it\'s closed. Let me click on this issue.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'target\': \'Outdated dependencies issue title link at the bottom of the issues list\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI can see the URL changed to "byteblaze/empathy-prompts/-/issues/18" and the tab title shows "Outdated dependencies (#..." but the page is still showing the issues list. Let me wait for the individual issue page to load.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'duration\': 2000}\n[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect! I have successfully opened the "Outdated dependencies" issue. Now I can see the issue details clearly:\n\n**Title:** Outdated dependencies\n**Status:** There\'s a green badge that says "Open" at the top left (near the title)\n**Description:** "The version of Gulp I use is no longer supported. I\'ll need to replatform this before any more issues can be addressed."\n**Created:** 4 years ago by Byte Blaze\n**Labels:** [Priority] Critical, [Status] Submitted, [Type] Bug\n\nThe issue status is **OPEN** (indicated by the green "Open" badge).\n\nSince the task asks me to check if the latest created issue with "dependency" in its title is closed, and I\'ve found that "Outdated dependencies" (created 4 years ago) is the latest such issue, and it is **OPEN** (not closed), I can now complete the task.\n[tool] mcp__task-completion__complete_task: {\'finalAnswer\': \'No\'}\n[complete] No\nThe task is complete! I found my latest created issue with "dependency" in its title, which is "Outdated dependencies" (created 4 years ago), and confirmed that it is **NOT closed** - it has an "Open" status.'}</pre></div><div class='parsed_action' style='background-color:yellow'><pre>stop [No]</pre></div></div>
