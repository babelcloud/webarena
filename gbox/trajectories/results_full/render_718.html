Good! I can see I'm on a Postmill site (a Reddit-like platform). The page shows I'm logged in as MarvelsGrantMan136 and I'm currently viewing the home page with Submissions and Comments tabs. I can see there's a message saying "You are not subscribed to any forum. Showing featured forums instead."

To complete the task of thumbs downing the top 5 posts ever in technology, I need to:
1. Navigate to the technology forum
2. Find the "top posts ever" view
3. Downvote the top 5 posts

Let me click on "Forums" to find the technology forum.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Forums link in the top navigation bar'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the page is loading (there's a loading indicator at the bottom). Let me wait a moment for the page to fully load.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I can see a list of forums. I need to find the "technology" forum. I can see several forums listed (AskReddit, relationship_advice, worldnews, news, movies, memes, wallstreetbets, gaming), but I need to scroll down to find the technology forum.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! I found the technology forum at the top of the current view. I can see "/r/technology" with "technology" as the name and 2,472 submissions. Let me click on it to navigate to the technology forum.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'technology link with text /r/technology'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the URL has changed to include /r/technology, but the page is still loading (I can see the loading indicator at the bottom). Let me wait for the page to fully load.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I'm on the technology forum page. I can see posts displayed with their vote counts. However, I'm currently viewing posts sorted by "Hot" (I can see the "Hot" dropdown button). To find the top 5 posts ever, I need to change the sorting to show "Top" posts of "All Time". Let me click on the "Hot" dropdown to see sorting options.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Hot dropdown button with downward arrow'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Great! A dropdown menu appeared with sorting options: Hot, New, Active, Top, Controversial, and Most commented. I need to click on "Top" to see the top posts.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Top option in the dropdown menu'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I can see the page has changed to show "Top" posts, and there's now a "Past 24 hours" dropdown visible. The URL has changed to include "top?t=day". The page shows "There's nothing here..." which means there are no top posts in the past 24 hours. I need to change the time filter to "All time" to see the top posts ever. Let me click on the "Past 24 hours" dropdown.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Past 24 hours dropdown button'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! The time filter dropdown is now open, showing options: Past 24 hours, Past week, Past month, Past year, and "All time". I need to click on "All time" to see the top posts ever.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'All time option in the dropdown menu'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! Now I can see the top posts of all time in the technology forum. The URL has changed to "top?t=all" and I can see posts with their vote counts. The top posts are:

1. "US judge orders Amazon to 'cease and desist' anti-union retaliation" - 7,109 votes
2. "11 states consider 'right to repair' for farming equipment" - 5,096 votes
3. "The Internet Archive is defending its digital library in court today" - 4,542 votes
4. "Apple sued for allegedly firing, threatening union organizers" - 4,172 votes
5. "Tesla Workers Announced a Union Drive. The Next Day They Were Fired." - 3,959 votes

Now I need to downvote (thumbs down) these top 5 posts. I'll click on the downvote arrow for each post. Let me start with the first post.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'downvote arrow below the 7,109 score for the post about US judge orders Amazon to cease and desist anti-union retaliation'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I can see the first post now shows a blue/highlighted downvote arrow, indicating I've successfully downvoted it. The score changed slightly. Now I need to downvote the remaining 4 posts. Let me click the downvote arrow for the second post.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'downvote arrow below the 5096 score for the post about 11 states consider right to repair for farming equipment'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! The second post now also shows a highlighted downvote arrow. Now let me downvote the third post about "The Internet Archive is defending its digital library in court today".
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'downvote arrow below the 4542 score for the post about The Internet Archive is defending its digital library in court today'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! The third post now has a highlighted downvote arrow as well. Now let me downvote the fourth post about "Apple sued for allegedly firing, threatening union organizers".
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'downvote arrow below the 4172 score for the post about Apple sued for allegedly firing, threatening union organizers'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! The fourth post now also has a highlighted downvote arrow. Now I need to downvote the fifth and final post about "Tesla Workers Announced a Union Drive. The Next Day They Were Fired."
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'downvote arrow below the 3959 score for the post about Tesla Workers Announced a Union Drive The Next Day They Were Fired'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I have successfully completed the task. All 5 top posts in the technology forum now have highlighted downvote arrows, indicating that I've downvoted them all. 

The 5 posts I downvoted were:
1. "US judge orders Amazon to 'cease and desist' anti-union retaliation" (originally 7,109 votes)
2. "11 states consider 'right to repair' for farming equipment" (originally 5,096 votes)
