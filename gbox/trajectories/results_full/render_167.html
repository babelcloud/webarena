Perfect! I can see a product page for "PHOTOSMART PLUS B209 CLR INKJETFB P/S/C USB/WRLS 1" printer. The page shows it has 2 Reviews with a 3-star rating. I need to scroll down to read the reviews and extract the criticisms. Let me scroll down to see the reviews section.

Good! I can see there are two tabs: "Details" and "Reviews (2)". I can see the Details tab is currently selected showing product specifications. I need to click on the "Reviews (2)" tab to read the actual reviews and find the criticisms.

Perfect! I can now see the Customer Reviews section. There are two reviews:

1. **First review - "Waste of big money"** (1-star rating) by sceneit, posted on 4/19/23:
   - This is a critical review with multiple complaints

2. **Second review - "Great printer"** (5-star rating) by James A Stevanus, posted on 4/19/23:
   - This is a positive review

I can see most of the critical review text, but let me make sure I capture all the criticisms from the first review. The main criticisms I can see are:

- "The wireless connection works on a whim (about 40% of the time I've owned it)"
- "it seems to constantly run out of ink"
- "Cartridge prices are less than some printers I've had, but now I understand why"
- "This printer seems to have more reasons NOT to work (none that are findable or correctable)"
- "Ex: error boxes saying that it's out of paper when it automatically switches to photo printing for some reason"
- "Scanner is as slow as my first scanner I ever owned in the mid-90's"
- "For the $176 I paid, there isn't even a fax component on it"
- "I guess the "PLUS" part of it's name is in reference to the migraines it causes when you can't figure out the new reason why it's not working for the 10th time in the past 2 months"

Let me scroll down slightly to ensure I haven't missed any additional criticisms in the review.

Perfect! Now I can see the complete review text. I have captured all the criticisms from the negative review. Let me extract the relevant critical sentences from the "Waste of big money" review:

The main criticisms are:

1. "The wireless connection works on a whim (about 40% of the time I've owned it), it seems to constantly run out of ink."
2. "Cartridge prices are less than some printers I've had, but now I understand why."
3. "This printer seems to have more reasons NOT to work (none that are findable or correctable) Ex: error boxes saying that it's out of paper when it automatically switches to photo printing for some reason."
4. "Scanner is as slow as my first scanner I ever owned in the mid-90's."
5. "For the $176 I paid, there isn't even a fax component on it."
6. "I guess the "PLUS" part of it's name is in reference to the migraines it causes when you can't figure out the new reason why it's not working for the 10th time in the past 2 months."

Now I'll complete the task with these extracted criticisms.

Task completed! I've extracted all the main criticisms from the product review. The criticisms cover:
- Unreliable wireless connectivity (40% uptime)
- Constantly running out of ink
- Expensive cartridges relative to quality
- Frequent errors and malfunctions
- Very slow scanner performance
- No fax component despite the price
- Overall unreliability and frustration</pre></div><div class='action_object' style='background-color:grey'><pre>{'action_type': <ActionTypes.STOP: 17>, 'coords': array([0., 0.], dtype=float32), 'element_role': 0, 'element_name': '', 'text': [], 'page_number': 0, 'url': '', 'nth': 0, 'pw_code': '', 'element_id': '', 'key_comb': '', 'direction': '', 'answer': 'The wireless connection works on a whim (about 40% of the time I\'ve owned it), it seems to constantly run out of ink.
