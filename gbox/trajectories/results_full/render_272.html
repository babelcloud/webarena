Good! I can see the "One Stop Market" website is open. I'm currently on the homepage. I need to find the "children dental care" category and then filter for products under $78. Let me look for this category by checking the navigation menu. I can see "Beauty & Personal Care" which might contain dental care products. Let me click on that.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Beauty & Personal Care menu item in the top navigation'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I'm now in the Beauty & Personal Care section. I can see it shows "Items 1-12 of 21796", so there are many products here. I need to find the "children dental care" subcategory. Let me scroll down to see if there are category filters or subcategories on the left side of the page.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see more products now, including some dental care items like "Soft Clean Between Interdental Floss Brushes" and "The Super Dentists Electric Toothbrush". Let me scroll back up to see if there are category filters on the left side of the page that I might have missed.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'long'}
[result] Scrolled up by long distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I can see the left sidebar with "Shop By" filters. I can see several categories including:
- Oral Care (3125)
- Skin Care (3074)
- Makeup (1883)
- Foot, Hand & Nail Care (794)
- Hair Care (4912)
- Tools & Accessories (3451)
- Fragrance (1311)
- Personal Care (1838)
- Shave & Hair Removal (799)
- Salon & Spa Equipment (609)

I need to click on "Oral Care" to find the children dental care subcategory.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Oral Care link with 3125 items in the left sidebar under Category section'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}

[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! Now I can see the Oral Care category is filtered and showing "Items 1-12 of 3125". On the left side, I can see subcategories including:
- Toothbrushes & Accessories (536)
- Dental Floss & Picks (441)
- Orthodontic Supplies (407)
- **Children's Dental Care (182)**
- Oral Pain Relief (88)
- Toothpaste (562)
- Teeth Whitening (128)
- Breath Fresheners (68)
- Denture Care (259)
- Tongue Cleaners (126)
- Mouthwash (196)

Perfect! I found "Children's Dental Care" with 182 items. Let me click on it.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': "Children's Dental Care link with 182 items in the left sidebar under Category section"}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The page is loading. Let me wait for it to fully load and then take a screenshot to see the filtered results.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I'm viewing the "Children's Dental Care" category with 182 items. I can see:
- The Super Dentists Electric Toothbrush - $16.99
- RZM® Kids Automatic Sonic Toothbrush - $34.99
- StarSmilez Tooth Brushing Magi Dragon Bundle - $31.88
- Kids Electric Toothbrush - $6.66

I can also see price filters on the left:
- $0.00 - $99.99 (179)
- $100.00 - $199.99 (2)
- $200.00 and above (1)

Now I need to filter for products under $78. Since most products (179) are already in the $0.00 - $99.99 range, I should look for a more specific price filter or scroll through to find products under $78. Let me scroll down to see if there are more filtering options or if I need to manually check the prices.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see more products:
- Tom's of Maine Anticavity Children's Toothpaste - $37.97
- 3 Sets Dental Mouth Prop Tongue Guard - $28.00
- Lion Toothbrush for Children EX - $210.91
- Simayixx Electric Toothbrush Kids - $16.53

I notice the prices vary widely. Since I need to find products under $78, and there are 182 items total, let me scroll back up and check if there's a way to set a custom price filter or if I should use the search/filter functionality more effectively. Let me scroll back to the top to see the filtering options.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'long'}
[result] Scrolled up by long distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I can see the price filters on the left side:
- $0.00 - $99.99 (179)
- $100.00 - $199.99 (2)
- $200.00 and above (1)

Since I need products under $78, and the first bracket is $0.00 - $99.99 (which contains 179 items), I should click on this filter first to narrow down the results. This will at least exclude the expensive items over $99.99. Then I can manually identify which products are under $78.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': '$0.00 - $99.99 price filter link showing 179 items in the left sidebar'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the page is still showing 182 items, but the URL has changed to include "price=0-100". Let me wait for the page to fully load and then I'll need to go through the products to identify which ones are under $78.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! Now I can see the results have been filtered to 179 items (down from 182). The page now shows more granular price filters:
- $0.00 - $9.99 (45)
- $10.00 - $19.99 (69)
- $20.00 - $29.99 (32)
- $30.00 - $39.99 (16)
- $40.00 - $49.99 (6)
- $50.00 - $59.99 (6)
- $60.00 - $69.99 (4)
- $70.00 and above (1)

Since I need products under $78, I need to identify all products in the ranges $0-$9.99, $10-$19.99, $20-$29.99, $30-$39.99, $40-$49.99, $50-$59.99, $60-$69.99, and check if the item in "$70.00 and above" is under $78.

Currently visible on this page:
1. The Super Dentists Electric Toothbrush - $16.99 ✓ (under $78)
2. RZM® Kids Automatic Sonic Toothbrush - $34.99 ✓ (under $78)
3. StarSmilez Tooth Brushing Magi Dragon Bundle - $31.88 ✓ (under $78)
4. Kids Electric Toothbrush - $6.66 ✓ (under $78)

Let me scroll down to see more products and gather all the products under $78.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see more products now:
5. Tom's of Maine Anticavity Children's Toothpaste - $37.97 ✓ (under $78)
6. 3 Sets Dental Mouth Prop Tongue Guard - $28.00 ✓ (under $78)
7. Simayixx Electric Toothbrush Kids - $16.53 ✓ (under $78)
8. Child Toothbrush, Quiet Operation - $10.89 ✓ (under $78)

I can also see partial views of more products at the bottom. Since there are 179 items and I need to list all products under $78, let me think about this more efficiently. Looking at the price breakdown:
- $0.00 - $69.99 = 45 + 69 + 32 + 16 + 6 + 6 + 4 = 178 items are definitely under $78
- $70.00 and above = 1 item (need to check if it's under $78)

So I need to check what the one item in the "$70.00 and above" category is. Let me scroll down to find it or use a better approach. Let me click on the "$70.00 and above" filter to see that specific item.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'long'}
[result] Scrolled up by long distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I can see the price filters clearly now:
- $0.00 - $9.99 (45)
- $10.00 - $19.99 (69)
- $20.00 - $29.99 (32)
- $30.00 - $39.99 (16)
- $40.00 - $49.99 (6)
- $50.00 - $59.99 (6)
- $60.00 - $69.99 (4)
- $70.00 and above (1)

To find products under $78, I need to check if the item in "$70.00 and above" is under $78 or not. Let me click on that filter to see what that product is.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': '$70.00 and above price filter link showing 1 item in the left sidebar'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the URL has changed to include "price=60-70%2C70-100" but the page is still showing 179 items. Let me wait for it to load and then take a screenshot.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I see it's now showing only 4 items. The filter seems to have selected both "$60.00 - $69.99" and "$70.00 and above". I can see:
1. FlekmanArt Kids U-Shaped Toothbrush - $61.30 ✓ (under $78)
2. Tom's of Maine Anticavity Fluoride Children's Toothpaste - $63.29 ✓ (under $78)
3. Spiderman Toothbrush Travel Kit - $61.08 ✓ (under $78)
4. Crest Kid's Toothpaste, Sparkle Fun - $60.07 ✓ (under $78)

Wait, these are all in the $60-$69 range. I need to scroll down to see if there's a product in the $70+ range that might be the 5th item.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see all 4 items now, and I've reached the bottom of the page. It says "Show 12 per page" which means all 4 items are displayed. So there are only 4 items in the $60-$69.99 range, not 5. Let me go back and check the "$70.00 and above" filter separately. Let me clear all filters first and start fresh.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'long'}
[result] Scrolled up by long distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the "Remove This Item" link next to the price filter. Let me click on "Clear All" to remove all filters and start fresh to properly identify all products under $78.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Clear All link in the left sidebar under the price filter'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I see the page still shows 4 items and still has the price filter showing "$60.00 - $69.99". Let me wait for the page to reload properly.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! Now I'm back at the main Beauty & Personal Care page with all 21796 items. I can see the category filter shows "Oral Care (3125)" and I need to navigate back to Children's Dental Care. Let me click on Oral Care first.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Oral Care link with 3125 items in the left sidebar under Category section'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The page is loading and shows "Items 1-12 of 3125" for Oral Care. Let me wait for it to fully load.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I'm back at the Oral Care category. I can see the "Children's Dental Care (182)" subcategory in the left sidebar. Let me click on it.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': "Children's Dental Care link with 182 items in the left sidebar under Category section"}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! The page is loading and shows "Items 1-12 of 182" for Children's Dental Care. Let me wait for it to fully load.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I'm in the Children's Dental Care category with 182 items. I can see the price breakdown:
- $0.00 - $99.99 (179)
- $100.00 - $199.99 (2)
- $200.00 and above (1)

Since I need products under $78, I should look at a more efficient approach. Based on what I learned earlier, when I filtered to $0.00 - $99.99, I saw these detailed price ranges:
- $0.00 - $9.99 (45)
- $10.00 - $19.99 (69)
- $20.00 - $29.99 (32)
- $30.00 - $39.99 (16)
- $40.00 - $49.99 (6)
- $50.00 - $59.99 (6)
- $60.00 - $69.99 (4)
- $70.00 and above (1)

Products under $78 would include:
- All items from $0.00 - $69.99 = 45 + 69 + 32 + 16 + 6 + 6 + 4 = 178 items
- Plus possibly the 1 item in "$70.00 and above" if it's between $70-$77.99

Let me use the sort feature to sort by price ascending, which will help me see all products and their prices in order. Let me change the sort dropdown.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Sort By dropdown menu showing Position'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Great! The dropdown is open and I can see the options:
- Position
- Product Name
- Price

Let me click on "Price" to sort by price.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Price option in the sort dropdown menu'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! The sort is now set to "Price". Let me wait for the page to reload with items sorted by price.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now the products are sorted by price in ascending order. I can see the first products:
1. Yuan! Childrens U-shape Toothbrush - $0.29 ✓
2. 360 Degree U Sonic Electric Toothbrush Children - $3.67 ✓
3. Brush Buddies Shopkins Toothbrush Set of 2 - $3.95 ✓
4. MagiDeal Kids Toothbrush Timer 2 Minute - $3.99 ✓

Now I need to find where the prices go over $78. Since there are 182 items total and I know:
- 179 items are under $100
- From the earlier filter breakdown: $0-$69.99 has 178 items, and $70+ has 1 item

So I need to check if that 1 item in the $70+ range is under $78 or not. Let me navigate to the end of the list to see the most expensive items. Since there are 182 items and they show 12 per page, I need to go to the last page. Let me scroll down to see pagination controls.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'long'}
[result] Scrolled down by long distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see more products:
- Children's Toothbrush U-shape - $3.99 ✓
- Kids Lil' Grip Toothbrush - $4.13 ✓
- Nature Clean 100% Natural Kids Toothpaste - $4.17 ✓
- Children's Toothbrush U-shaped Age 2-12 - $4.19 ✓

Let me continue scrolling down to find pagination or navigate to see the higher priced items.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'long'}
[result] Scrolled down by long distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I can see the pagination at the bottom. The last products on page 1 are:
- Electric Toothbrush Kids - $4.49 ✓
- HEALTH SMART TOOTHBRUSHES KID 4PK - $4.95 ✓
- Tebatu Waterproof Rotating Electric Toothbrush - $4.96 ✓
- 2-Pack Kids' Soft Bristle Toothbrush - $4.99 ✓

I can see there are pages 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and more (indicated by the arrow). Since I need to find the cutoff point at $78, let me navigate to the last page to see the most expensive items. There are 182 items, 12 per page, so that's about 16 pages (182/12 = 15.17). Let me click on the next arrow to see more page numbers or use a different approach.

Actually, based on what I learned earlier from the price filters, I know that:
- 178 items are priced $0.00 - $69.99 (definitely under $78)
- 1 item is priced $70.00 and above (need to check if under $78)
- 3 items are priced $100.00 and above (definitely over $78)

So the answer is likely either 178 or 179 products under $78, depending on whether that 1 item in the $70+ range is under or over $78.

Let me navigate to page 15 or 16 to see the highest priced items. Let me click on the next arrow multiple times or type in the URL to go to the last page. Let me try clicking the next page arrow.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'next page arrow button in the pagination section showing pages 1 2 3 4 5'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The page URL shows "p=2" now but the display hasn't updated yet. Let me wait for it to load.

Good! Now I'm on page 2 showing "Items 13-24 of 182". The products here are:
- Brushing Set - Eco Travel Kit - $4.99 ✓
- Colgate Kids Electric Battery Powered Toothbrush - $5.00 ✓
- Dental Diastema Ruler, 4pcs / Set - $5.09 ✓
- #N/D Tongue Scraper for Oral Care - $5.27 ✓

These are still very low prices. Rather than clicking through all 16 pages, let me use a more efficient approach. Let me modify the URL directly to go to the last page (page 16, since 182/12 = 15.17, so the last page would be 16). Let me try navigating to page 15 or 16 directly by modifying the URL parameter.

Actually, let me use the "Show per page" dropdown to show more items per page. I can see it currently shows "12 per page". Let me scroll down to see if I can change this to show more items, like 96 or all items, which would help me see the expensive items faster.

Good! I can see the pagination now. The last items on page 2 are around $6.58-$6.95. I can see pages 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 with navigation arrows. Let me click on "5" to jump ahead faster, or I can use the "Show 12 per page" dropdown to increase the number of items per page. Let me click on the dropdown to see if I can show more items per page.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Show 12 per page dropdown menu at the bottom right of the page'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The dropdown didn't open. Let me try a different approach. Based on what I learned from the price filter earlier, I know that:
- 178 products are in the $0.00-$69.99 range (definitely under $78)
- 1 product is in the $70.00 and above range

So I need to identify that 1 product priced $70+ to see if it's under or over $78. Let me go back and use the price filter to find that specific item. Let me scroll up to access the price filters.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'long'}
[result] Scrolled up by long distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see I'm partway down the page. I can see at the top there's a "$200.00 and above (1)" filter visible. Let me scroll up more to see the full price filter section.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'long'}
[result] Scrolled up by long distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I can see the price filters clearly on the left:
- $0.00 - $99.99 (179)
- $100.00 - $199.99 (2)
- $200.00 and above (1)

Wait, I notice the breakdown has changed slightly from what I saw earlier. Let me click on the $0.00 - $99.99 filter to see the detailed breakdown again, which will show me the $70+ item.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': '$0.00 - $99.99 price filter link showing 179 items in the left sidebar'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the URL now includes "price=0-100". Let me wait for the page to reload to see the detailed price breakdown.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! Now I can see the detailed price breakdown for items under $100:
- $0.00 - $9.99 (45)
- $10.00 - $19.99 (69)
- $20.00 - $29.99 (32)
- $30.00 - $39.99 (16)
- $40.00 - $49.99 (6)
- $50.00 - $59.99 (6)
- $60.00 - $69.99 (4)
- **$70.00 and above (1)**

Perfect! Now I can see there's exactly 1 item in the "$70.00 and above" category. I need to check if this item is under $78 or not. Since this page is sorted by price and shows items 1-12 of 179, and I need to find that 1 item in the $70+ range, let me navigate to the end of the list. 

Actually, let me click on the "$70.00 and above" filter to see that specific item.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': '$70.00 and above price filter link showing 1 item in the left sidebar'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The page is loading. I can see the URL now shows "price=70..." at the end. Let me wait for it to fully load.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I found the item in the $70+ range! It shows:
- **"1 Item"**
- Price filter: **$70.00 - $79.99**
- The product: **"NA Children's Electric Toothbrush Rechargeable Soft Bristle Children's Toothbrush Automatic Cartoon Toothbrush"**
- **Price: $72.09**

Since $72.09 < $78, this item IS under $78!

So the total count of products under $78 in the "children dental care" category is:
- All items from $0.00 - $69.99: 45 + 69 + 32 + 16 + 6 + 6 + 4 = 178 items
- Plus this 1 item at $72.09: 1 item
- **Total: 179 items under $78**

Now I have the answer. There are 179 products under $78 in the children dental care category.
[tool] mcp__task-completion__complete_task: {'finalAnswer': '179'}
[complete] 179
Task completed! I found that there are **179 products** under $78 in the "children dental care" category on the One Stop Market website.

Here's how I determined this:
1. Navigated to Beauty & Personal Care → Oral Care → Children's Dental Care (182 total items)
2. Filtered by price to analyze the distribution
3. Found that 178 items are priced $0.00-$69.99 (definitely under $78)
4. Identified 1 item in the $70-$79.99 range: "NA Children's Electric Toothbrush" at $72.09 (also under $78)

It says "Show 12 per page" which means all 4 items are displayed. So there are only 4 items in the $60-$69.99 range, not 5. Let me go back and check the "$70.00 and above" filter separately.

Let me click on it.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'target\': "Children\'s Dental Care link with 182 items in the left sidebar under Category section"}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood!

Now I\'m in the Children\'s Dental Care category with 182 items. I can see the price breakdown:\n- $0.00 - $99.99 (179)\n- $100.00 - $199.99 (2)\n- $200.00 and above (1)\n\nSince I need products under $78, I should look at a more efficient approach. Based on what I learned earlier, when I filtered to $0.00 - $99.99, I saw these detailed price ranges:\n- $0.00 - $9.99 (45)\n- $10.00 - $19.99 (69)\n- $20.00 - $29.99 (32)\n- $30.00 - $39.99 (16)\n- $40.00 - $49.99 (6)\n- $50.00 - $59.99 (6)\n- $60.00 - $69.99 (4)\n- $70.00 and above (1)\n\nProducts under $78 would include:\n- All items from $0.00 - $69.99 = 45 + 69 + 32 + 16 + 6 + 6 + 4 = 178 items\n- Plus possibly the 1 item in "$70.00 and above" if it\'s between $70-$77.99\n\nLet me use the sort feature to sort by price ascending, which will help me see all products and their prices in order. Let me change the sort dropdown.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'target\': \'Sort By dropdown menu showing Position\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGreat!

The sort is now set to "Price". Let me wait for the page to reload with items sorted by price.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'duration\': 2000}\n[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect! Now the products are sorted by price in ascending order. I can see the first products:\n1. Yuan! Childrens U-shape Toothbrush - $0.29 ✓\n2. 360 Degree U Sonic Electric Toothbrush Children - $3.67 ✓\n3. Brush Buddies Shopkins Toothbrush Set of 2 - $3.95 ✓\n4. MagiDeal Kids Toothbrush Timer 2 Minute - $3.99 ✓\n\nNow I need to find where the prices go over $78. Since there are 182 items total and I know:\n- 179 items are under $100\n- From the earlier filter breakdown: $0-$69.99 has 178 items, and $70+ has 1 item\n\nSo I need to check if that 1 item in the $70+ range is under $78 or not. Let me navigate to the end of the list to see the most expensive items. Since there are 182 items and they show 12 per page, I need to go to the last page. Let me scroll down to see pagination controls.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'direction\': \'down\', \'distance\': \'long\'}\n[result] Scrolled down by long distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI can see more products:\n- Children\'s Toothbrush U-shape - $3.99 ✓\n- Kids Lil\' Grip Toothbrush - $4.13 ✓\n- Nature Clean 100% Natural Kids Toothpaste - $4.17 ✓\n- Children\'s Toothbrush U-shaped Age 2-12 - $4.19 ✓\n\nLet me continue scrolling down to find pagination or navigate to see the higher priced items.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'direction\': \'down\', \'distance\': \'long\'}\n[result] Scrolled down by long distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect! I can see the pagination at the bottom. The last products on page 1 are:\n- Electric Toothbrush Kids - $4.49 ✓\n- HEALTH SMART TOOTHBRUSHES KID 4PK - $4.95 ✓\n- Tebatu Waterproof Rotating Electric Toothbrush - $4.96 ✓\n- 2-Pack Kids\' Soft Bristle Toothbrush - $4.99 ✓\n\nI can see there are pages 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and more (indicated by the arrow). Since I need to find the cutoff point at $78, let me navigate to the last page to see the most expensive items. There are 182 items, 12 per page, so that\'s about 16 pages (182/12 = 15.17). Let me click on the next arrow to see more page numbers or use a different approach.\n\nActually, based on what I learned earlier from the price filters, I know that:\n- 178 items are priced $0.00 - $69.99 (definitely under $78)\n- 1 item is priced $70.00 and above (need to check if under $78)\n- 3 items are priced $100.00 and above (definitely over $78)\n\nSo the answer is likely either 178 or 179 products under $78, depending on whether that 1 item in the $70+ range is under or over $78.\n\nLet me navigate to page 15 or 16 to see the highest priced items. Let me click on the next arrow multiple times or type in the URL to go to the last page. Let me try clicking the next page arrow.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'target\': \'next page arrow button in the pagination section showing pages 1 2 3 4 5\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nThe page URL shows "p=2" now but the display hasn\'t updated yet.

Now I\'m on page 2 showing "Items 13-24 of 182". The products here are:\n- Brushing Set - Eco Travel Kit - $4.99 ✓\n- Colgate Kids Electric Battery Powered Toothbrush - $5.00 ✓\n- Dental Diastema Ruler, 4pcs / Set - $5.09 ✓\n- #N/D Tongue Scraper for Oral Care - $5.27 ✓\n\nThese are still very low prices. Rather than clicking through all 16 pages, let me use a more efficient approach. Let me modify the URL directly to go to the last page (page 16, since 182/12 = 15.17, so the last page would be 16). Let me try navigating to page 15 or 16 directly by modifying the URL parameter.\n\nActually, let me use the "Show per page" dropdown to show more items per page. I can see it currently shows "12 per page". Let me scroll down to see if I can change this to show more items, like 96 or all items, which would help me see the expensive items faster.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'direction\': \'down\', \'distance\': \'long\'}\n[result] Scrolled down by long distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI can see more products, still all under $10.

I can see the pagination now. The last items on page 2 are around $6.58-$6.95. I can see pages 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 with navigation arrows. Let me click on "5" to jump ahead faster, or I can use the "Show 12 per page" dropdown to increase the number of items per page. Let me click on the dropdown to see if I can show more items per page.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'target\': \'Show 12 per page dropdown menu at the bottom right of the page\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nThe dropdown didn\'t open. Let me try a different approach. Based on what I learned from the price filter earlier, I know that:\n- 178 products are in the $0.00-$69.99 range (definitely under $78)\n- 1 product is in the $70.00 and above range\n\nSo I need to identify that 1 product priced $70+ to see if it\'s under or over $78. Let me go back and use the price filter to find that specific item. Let me scroll up to access the price filters.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'direction\': \'up\', \'distance\': \'long\'}\n[result] Scrolled up by long distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI can see I\'m partway down the page.

Let me click on the $0.00 - $99.99 filter to see the detailed breakdown again, which will show me the $70+ item.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'target\': \'$0.00 - $99.99 price filter link showing 179 items in the left sidebar\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI can see the URL now includes "price=0-100".

Now I can see there\'s exactly 1 item in the "$70.00 and above" category. I need to check if this item is under $78 or not. Since this page is sorted by price and shows items 1-12 of 179, and I need to find that 1 item in the $70+ range, let me navigate to the end of the list. \n\nActually, let me click on the "$70.00 and above" filter to see that specific item.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'target\': \'$70.00 and above price filter link showing 1 item in the left sidebar\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nThe page is loading.

I found the item in the $70+ range!
