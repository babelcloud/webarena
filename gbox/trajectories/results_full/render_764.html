[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! The search found the location. I can see:

**Search Results**
- Apartments: Kenmawr Apartments, 401, Shady Avenue, Shadyside, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, 15206, United States

This appears to be the exact address I was looking for. Now I need to click on this result to set it as my starting point, and then I'll need to search for Target stores nearby to find the closest one.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'Kenmawr Apartments, 401, Shady Avenue, Shadyside, Pittsburgh link in the search results'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! The map has zoomed to the Kenmawr Apartments location at 401 Shady Avenue in Pittsburgh. The building is highlighted in orange on the map. I can see it's located on Shady Avenue near Walnut Street.

Now I need to search for Target stores near this location. Let me use the search function to find nearby Target stores. I'll click on the search box and search for "Target".
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'Search text input field at the top left'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the search field is active with "Carnegie Mellon Cafe" showing as a suggestion. I need to clear this and search for Target stores near this location. Let me type "Target Pittsburgh".
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'content': 'Target Pittsburgh', 'replace': True}
[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I've typed "Target Pittsburgh" in the search box. Now let me click the "Go" button to search for Target locations.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'Go button next to the search field'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! I found several Target locations in Pittsburgh:

1. **Supermarket Target, 6231, Penn Avenue, East Liberty, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, 15206, United States**
2. **Department Store Target, 482, Smithfield Street, Fifth & Forbes, Downtown, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, 15219, United States**
3. **Department Store Target, 288, Mount Nebo Pointe Road, Mt Nebo Pointe, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, 15237, United States**

I need to determine which one is closest to 401 Shady Ave. The first one (6231 Penn Avenue, East Liberty) has the same zip code (15206) as the starting address, which suggests it might be the closest. Let me click on the first Target location to see its exact location and then get directions.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'Target, 6231, Penn Avenue, East Liberty, Pittsburgh link in the search results'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I can see the Target location at 6231 Penn Avenue in East Liberty, Pittsburgh. The building is highlighted in orange on the map. I can see it's located on Penn Avenue near Centre Avenue. 

Now I need to get directions from 401 Shady Ave to this Target location to determine the walkway/route. Let me look for a directions feature. In OpenStreetMap, I need to use the routing feature. Let me click on the "Where is this?" link or look for a directions button. Let me scroll down in the left panel to see if there are more options.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'short'}
[result] Scrolled down by short distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the map has zoomed out showing the Target location. Now I need to get directions from 401 Shady Ave to this Target. Let me look for the directions feature. I'll click on "Where is this?" link to see if it provides routing options, or I can use the icon buttons at the top. Let me click on the directions/route icon button (the one with arrows).
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'Where is this? link with blue text in the search area at the top left'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! The map has zoomed out to show the wider Pittsburgh area. I can see both the Target location and need to find the route from 401 Shady Ave. However, I notice the search field now shows "Carnegie Mellon Cafe" again. Let me look for the proper directions/routing feature. I should click on the icon button that looks like it's for directions. Let me look at the top area - I see there's a button with arrows icon next to the "Go" button. Let me click on that.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'Blue button with direction arrows icon next to the Go button'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
That opened a "Share" dialog with link and image options. That's not what I need. Let me close this and look for the proper directions feature. Let me close this dialog first.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'X button in the top right corner of the Share dialog'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good, the share dialog is closed. Now I need to find the directions feature. In OpenStreetMap, I should look for a "Directions" option. Let me check if there's a right-click context menu on the Target location, or I can look in the top menu. Let me try right-clicking on the Target location on the map to see if there's a "Get directions to here" option.

Actually, let me try a different approach. I'll search for "401 Shady Ave to Target Pittsburgh" to get directions directly. Let me click on the search box.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'Search text input field at the top left'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I see the search box is active. Let me try a better approach - I'll use the main OpenStreetMap website's routing feature. Let me look for the "Directions" option in the top menu bar. I can see tabs for "Edit", "History", "Export" at the top. Let me check if there's a directions feature by looking at the URL or trying to access a directions page directly.

Actually, let me try using an external routing service. But first, let me try to see if I can access OpenStreetMap's routing by modifying the approach. Let me close the left panel and see if there's a directions button on the map itself.

Let me try clicking on the close button for the left panel to see the full map.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'X button to close the Way: Target information panel on the left side'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! Now I have the full map view. I can see Pittsburgh clearly. Now I need to access the directions/routing feature. In OpenStreetMap, I need to look for a "Directions" link or button. Let me try right-clicking on the map to see if there's a context menu, or I can manually navigate to the directions URL. 

Actually, let me try a more direct approach - I'll manually calculate the route by zooming in to see both locations. But first, let me check if there's a directions feature by looking at the right-side panel icons. I can see several icons on the right side of the map. Let me try clicking on one that might be for directions/routing.

Actually, I notice this is the standard OpenStreetMap.org interface, and to get directions, I typically need to use a routing service. Let me try accessing the routing by using the search with "from/to" format or by using an external service like OSRM (Open Source Routing Machine). 

Let me try right-clicking on the map to see if there's a "Directions from here" or "Directions to here" option.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'The center of Pittsburgh on the map', 'button': 'right'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
This shows a browser context menu, not an OpenStreetMap context menu. Let me close this and try a different approach. Let me press Escape to close this menu and then search for a routing service URL.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'keys': ['escape']}
[result] Keys pressed successfully
Let me take a different approach. Since I know the two locations (401 Shady Ave and Target at 6231 Penn Avenue), let me manually navigate to see if there's a routing service integrated in this OpenStreetMap instance. Let me try modifying the URL to access a directions page, or I can search for both locations and visually determine the route.

Actually, let me try using the search to find both locations and see the distance. First, let me search for "401 Shady Ave Pittsburgh" again and then note its location, then search for the Target and see which route would be the walkway.

Let me try accessing the directions by typing in the URL bar. But first, let me check if there's a "Directions" link anywhere on the page. Let me take a screenshot to see the current state.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c'}
[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Let me try accessing the OpenStreetMap routing service directly by modifying the URL. I'll navigate to a directions page. Let me click on the URL bar and type a directions URL.

Actually, let me try a simpler approach - I'll search for both locations individually and check if there are other Target locations that might be closer. But first, let me verify which Target is actually closest by checking all three options I found earlier.

Let me search for the starting address again to compare distances. Let me click on the search box.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'Search text input field at the top left'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Let me try a different approach. Let me navigate directly to a routing service by typing in the address bar. Let me try accessing the routing by clicking on the URL bar and typing a routing service URL.

Actually, let me check if this OpenStreetMap instance has routing built in. Let me look in the URL to see the domain and then try to access directions from there. I can see the URL is `ec2-3-149-78-74.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3000`. This appears to be a custom instance. Let me try accessing routing by going to the /directions path.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'URL address bar at the top of the browser'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! The URL bar is now active and I can see it's selected. Let me try navigating to the directions page by modifying the URL. Let me type a new URL with /directions path.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'content': 'http://ec2-3-149-78-74.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3000/directions', 'replace': True, 'pressEnterAfterType': True}
[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the URL changed to `/directions` and the page is loading (there's a loading spinner icon). Let me wait for the page to load.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! The directions page has loaded! I can see:
- A "From" field with a green pin icon
- A "To" field with a red pin icon
- A dropdown showing "Car (OSRM)"
- A "Go" button
- A "Reverse Directions" link
- The Welcome to OpenStreetMap dialog has appeared again

Let me close the welcome dialog first, then I'll enter the addresses.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'X button to close the Welcome to OpenStreetMap dialog'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I have the directions interface. I need to change the mode from "Car (OSRM)" to walking mode since I need to find the walkway. But first, let me enter the addresses. Let me click on the "From" field and enter the starting address.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'From text input field'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! The "From" field is now active (I can see the blue outline). Let me type the starting address.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'content': '401 Shady Ave, Pittsburgh'}
[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I've entered the starting address "401 Shady Ave, Pittsburgh" in the From field. Now let me click on the "To" field and enter the Target location.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'To text input field'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! The "From" field now shows "Kenmawr Apartments, 401, Shady Avenue," and I can see a green pin marker on the map showing the starting location. The "To" field is now active (blue outline). Let me type the Target destination.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'content': 'Target, 6231 Penn Avenue, Pittsburgh'}
[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I've entered both addresses:
- From: Kenmawr Apartments, 401, Shady Avenue
- To: Target, 6231 Penn Avenue, Pittsburgh

Now I need to change the routing mode from "Car (OSRM)" to walking/pedestrian mode since the task asks for the "walkway." Let me click on the dropdown to see the available modes.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'Car (OSRM) dropdown menu'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! The dropdown menu is showing three options:
- Bicycle (OSRM)
- Car (OSRM) - currently selected (highlighted in blue)
- Foot (OSRM)

Since the task asks for the "walkway," I need to select "Foot (OSRM)" for walking directions. Let me click on it.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'Foot (OSRM) option in the dropdown menu'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! The walking directions have been calculated! I can see the complete route on the map with a blue line showing the path from the green pin (Kenmawr Apartments at 401 Shady Avenue) to the red pin (Target at 6231 Penn Avenue).

The directions panel shows:
**Distance: 920m. Time: 0:12** (12 minutes walking)

And I can see the detailed turn-by-turn directions:
1. Start on unnamed road - 50m
2. Turn left onto **Walnut Street** - 130m
3. Turn right onto **Shady Avenue** - 400m
4. Turn left onto unnamed road - 20m
5. Slight left onto unnamed road - 90m
6. At the fork turn right onto unnamed road - 70m
7. At the end of the road turn left onto unnamed road - 10m
8. Turn right onto unnamed road - 30m
9. At the end of the road turn left onto unnamed road - 10m
10. Turn right onto **Centre Avenue (PA 380)** - 50m
11. Turn right onto unnamed road - 90m
12. Reach destination

The walkway route goes through **Walnut Street**, **Shady Avenue**, and **Centre Avenue (PA 380)** as the main named streets. Let me read the directions more carefully to provide the exact answer. Looking at the map, I can see the route clearly marked.

Let me scroll down to see if there are more details or to confirm the route.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'short'}
[result] Scrolled down by short distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I can see the complete walking directions and the route on the map. The map now shows a zoomed-out view with both the green pin (start at 401 Shady Ave) and red pin (Target) visible, with the blue route connecting them.

Based on the directions shown, the main streets in the walkway are:
- **Walnut Street** (130m)
- **Shady Avenue** (400m - the longest segment)
- **Centre Avenue (PA 380)** (50m)

The route is 920m total distance with an estimated walking time of 12 minutes.

Looking at the task requirements, I need to provide the answer for "the walkway to the closest Target from 401 Shady Ave, Pittsburgh." The answer should describe the route/walkway taken.

Based on the OpenStreetMap directions, the walkway goes primarily along **Walnut Street**, then **Shady Avenue**, and finally **Centre Avenue** to reach the Target at 6231 Penn Avenue in East Liberty.

However, I should provide the answer in a clear format. Let me call the complete_task function with the appropriate answer format. Looking at the instructions, I need to provide the exact information as displayed on the screen.

The walkway directions show the main route is: starting from 401 Shady Avenue, turn onto Walnut Street, then onto Shady Avenue, and finally onto Centre Avenue (PA 380) to reach Target at 6231 Penn Avenue, East Liberty, Pittsburgh.

The map has zoomed to the Kenmawr Apartments location at 401 Shady Avenue in Pittsburgh. The building is highlighted in orange on the map. I can see it\'s located on Shady Avenue near Walnut Street.\n\nNow I need to search for Target stores near this location. Let me use the search function to find nearby Target stores. I\'ll click on the search box and search for "Target".\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c\', \'target\': \'Search text input field at the top left\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI can see the search field is active with "Carnegie Mellon Cafe" showing as a suggestion.

Let me click on the first Target location to see its exact location and then get directions.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c\', \'target\': \'Target, 6231, Penn Avenue, East Liberty, Pittsburgh link in the search results\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect! I can see the Target location at 6231 Penn Avenue in East Liberty, Pittsburgh. The building is highlighted in orange on the map. I can see it\'s located on Penn Avenue near Centre Avenue. \n\nNow I need to get directions from 401 Shady Ave to this Target location to determine the walkway/route. Let me look for a directions feature. In OpenStreetMap, I need to use the routing feature. Let me click on the "Where is this?" link or look for a directions button. Let me scroll down in the left panel to see if there are more options.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c\', \'direction\': \'down\', \'distance\': \'short\'}\n[result] Scrolled down by short distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI can see the map has zoomed out showing the Target location. Now I need to get directions from 401 Shady Ave to this Target. Let me look for the directions feature. I\'ll click on "Where is this?" link to see if it provides routing options, or I can use the icon buttons at the top. Let me click on the directions/route icon button (the one with arrows).\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c\', \'target\': \'Where is this? link with blue text in the search area at the top left\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood! The map has zoomed out to show the wider Pittsburgh area. I can see both the Target location and need to find the route from 401 Shady Ave. However, I notice the search field now shows "Carnegie Mellon Cafe" again. Let me look for the proper directions/routing feature. I should click on the icon button that looks like it\'s for directions. Let me look at the top area - I see there\'s a button with arrows icon next to the "Go" button. Let me click on that.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c\', \'target\': \'Blue button with direction arrows icon next to the Go button\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nThat opened a "Share" dialog with link and image options.

Now I need to find the directions feature. In OpenStreetMap, I should look for a "Directions" option. Let me check if there\'s a right-click context menu on the Target location, or I can look in the top menu. Let me try right-clicking on the Target location on the map to see if there\'s a "Get directions to here" option.\n\nActually, let me try a different approach. I\'ll search for "401 Shady Ave to Target Pittsburgh" to get directions directly. Let me click on the search box.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c\', \'target\': \'Search text input field at the top left\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI see the search box is active. Let me try a better approach - I\'ll use the main OpenStreetMap website\'s routing feature. Let me look for the "Directions" option in the top menu bar. I can see tabs for "Edit", "History", "Export" at the top. Let me check if there\'s a directions feature by looking at the URL or trying to access a directions page directly.\n\nActually, let me try using an external routing service. But first, let me try to see if I can access OpenStreetMap\'s routing by modifying the approach. Let me close the left panel and see if there\'s a directions button on the map itself.\n\nLet me try clicking on the close button for the left panel to see the full map.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c\', \'target\': \'X button to close the Way: Target information panel on the left side\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood! Now I have the full map view. I can see Pittsburgh clearly. Now I need to access the directions/routing feature. In OpenStreetMap, I need to look for a "Directions" link or button. Let me try right-clicking on the map to see if there\'s a context menu, or I can manually navigate to the directions URL. \n\nActually, let me try a more direct approach - I\'ll manually calculate the route by zooming in to see both locations. But first, let me check if there\'s a directions feature by looking at the right-side panel icons. I can see several icons on the right side of the map. Let me try clicking on one that might be for directions/routing.\n\nActually, I notice this is the standard OpenStreetMap.org interface, and to get directions, I typically need to use a routing service. Let me try accessing the routing by using the search with "from/to" format or by using an external service like OSRM (Open Source Routing Machine). \n\nLet me try right-clicking on the map to see if there\'s a "Directions from here" or "Directions to here" option.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c\', \'target\': \'The center of Pittsburgh on the map\', \'button\': \'right\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nThis shows a browser context menu, not an OpenStreetMap context menu. Let me close this and try a different approach. Let me press Escape to close this menu and then search for a routing service URL.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {\'boxId\': \'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c\', \'keys\': [\'escape\']}\n[result] Keys pressed successfully\nLet me take a different approach. Since I know the two locations (401 Shady Ave and Target at 6231 Penn Avenue), let me manually navigate to see if there\'s a routing service integrated in this OpenStreetMap instance. Let me try modifying the URL to access a directions page, or I can search for both locations and visually determine the route.\n\nActually, let me try using the search to find both locations and see the distance. First, let me search for "401 Shady Ave Pittsburgh" again and then note its location, then search for the Target and see which route would be the walkway.\n\nLet me try accessing the directions by typing in the URL bar. But first, let me check if there\'s a "Directions" link anywhere on the page. Let me take a screenshot to see the current state.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {\'boxId\': \'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c\'}\n[result] {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nLet me try accessing the OpenStreetMap routing service directly by modifying the URL. I\'ll navigate to a directions page. Let me click on the URL bar and type a directions URL.\n\nActually, let me try a simpler approach - I\'ll search for both locations individually and check if there are other Target locations that might be closer. But first, let me verify which Target is actually closest by checking all three options I found earlier.\n\nLet me search for the starting address again to compare distances. Let me click on the search box.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c\', \'target\': \'Search text input field at the top left\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nLet me try a different approach. Let me navigate directly to a routing service by typing in the address bar. Let me try accessing the routing by clicking on the URL bar and typing a routing service URL.\n\nActually, let me check if this OpenStreetMap instance has routing built in. Let me look in the URL to see the domain and then try to access directions from there. I can see the URL is `ec2-3-149-78-74.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3000`.
