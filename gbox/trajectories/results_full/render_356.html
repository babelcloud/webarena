Good! I can see OpenStreetMap is already open. Now I need to:
1. Find the location where the Declaration of Independence and Constitution were signed (Independence Hall in Philadelphia)
2. Get directions from SCS CMU in Pittsburgh to that location

Let me first close the welcome dialog and then search for directions.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'X button in the top right corner of the Welcome to OpenStreetMap dialog'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! The welcome dialog is closed. Now I need to get directions. I can see there's a button with directions icon (arrow) next to the "Go" button. Let me click on that to access the directions feature.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Blue button with arrows icon next to the Go button in the search bar area'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! The directions interface is now open. I can see:
- A "From" field (with green marker)
- A "To" field (with red marker)
- A "Car (OSRM)" dropdown for transportation mode
- A "Go" button

Now I need to:
1. Enter "SCS CMU Pittsburgh" in the From field
2. Enter "Independence Hall Philadelphia" (where the Declaration of Independence and Constitution were signed) in the To field

Let me start by clicking on the "From" field and entering the starting location.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'From text input field with green marker icon'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! The "From" field is now focused (I can see the cursor is in that field). Now I'll type "SCS CMU Pittsburgh".
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'content': 'SCS CMU Pittsburgh', 'pressEnterAfterType': False}
[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! "SCS CMU Pittsburgh" has been entered in the "From" field. Now I need to click on the "To" field and enter "Independence Hall Philadelphia" (the location where both the Declaration of Independence and Constitution were signed).
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'To text input field with red marker icon'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I see there's an error dialog saying "Sorry - couldn't locate 'SCS CMU Pittsburgh'." This means OpenStreetMap couldn't find that exact location. Let me click "OK" to dismiss this dialog and try a more specific address. I should search for "School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh" or just "Carnegie Mellon University Pittsburgh".
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'OK button in the error dialog'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good, the dialog is dismissed. Now let me clear the "From" field and try a different search term. Let me click on the "From" field and replace it with "Carnegie Mellon University Pittsburgh".
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'From text input field showing SCS CMU Pittsburgh'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good, the field is focused. Now let me select all the text and replace it with a better search term. Let me use Ctrl+A to select all and then type the new text.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'keys': ['control', 'a']}
[result] Keys pressed successfully
Now let me type a new search term that OpenStreetMap is more likely to recognize:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'content': 'Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA', 'pressEnterAfterType': False}
[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! Now I have "Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA" in the From field. Now I need to click on the "To" field and enter the destination - Independence Hall in Philadelphia (where both the Declaration of Independence and Constitution were signed).
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'To text input field with red marker icon'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I can see the "To" field is now focused and there's a green marker showing on the map (around Pittsburgh area). Now I'll type "Independence Hall, Philadelphia, PA" which is where both the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution were signed.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'content': 'Independence Hall, Philadelphia, PA', 'pressEnterAfterType': False}
[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! Both fields are now filled in:
- From: Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, All (shows as abbreviated)
- To: Independence Hall, Philadelphia, PA

Now I need to click the "Go" button to get the directions and show the route on the map.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Go button in blue color next to the Car (OSRM) dropdown'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Great! The system is loading the route. I can see:
- A loading spinner on the left side panel
- A green marker (starting point - Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh)
- A red marker (destination - Independence Hall in Philadelphia)
- The URL has updated with routing parameters

Let me wait a moment for the route to fully load and display.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'duration': 3000}
[result] Finished waiting for 3000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! The route has been successfully loaded and is now displayed on the map. I can see:

**Route Information:**
- **From:** Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA (green marker)
- **To:** Independence Hall, 520, Chestnut Street (red marker in Philadelphia)
- **Distance:** 489km
- **Time:** 5:46 (5 hours 46 minutes)

**The blue route line** is clearly visible on the map showing the path from Pittsburgh to Philadelphia. The route goes through various highways and roads, and the left panel shows detailed turn-by-turn directions including:
1. Start on Forbes Avenue
2. Slight right onto Forbes Avenue
3. Turn right onto Murdoch Street
4. Turn right onto Bartlett Street
5. And many more steps...

The task has been completed - I've successfully shown the route from SCS CMU in Pittsburgh to Independence Hall in Philadelphia (the location where both the Declaration of Independence and Constitution were signed). The route is clearly displayed on the map with both starting and ending points marked.
