[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__list_tabs: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608'}
[result] {
  "data": [

      "url": "chrome://new-tab-page/",
      "favicon": "chrome://new-tab-page/favicon.ico",
      "active": true,
      "loading": false
Now let me switch to the One Stop Market tab and take a screenshot to see the current state:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__switch_tab: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'tabId': '2'}
[result] Switched to tab 2 successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I'm on the One Stop Market website and I can see it's a shopping site. To find the total cost of the latest processing order, I need to access my account and view my order history. I can see "My Account" link in the top right. Let me click on it:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'My Account link in the top right navigation bar'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the page is loading (there's a loading indicator in the tab). Let me wait for it to load completely:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I'm now on the My Account page and I can see the "Recent Orders" section at the bottom. I can see two orders listed:

1. Order #000000194 - Date: 10/26/25 - Order Total: $173.56 - Status: Pending
2. Order #000000193 - Date: 10/26/25 - Order Total: $18.98 - Status: Pending

Both orders are from the same date (10/26/25), which is today. To determine which is the "latest processing order," I need to click on "My Orders" in the left sidebar to see the full order history and identify which order is the most recent processing order.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'My Orders link in the left sidebar navigation menu'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the page is loading. Let me wait for it to complete:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! Now I can see the full order history. I can see multiple orders with different statuses:

- Orders with "Pending" status (most recent ones from 10/26/25)
- Order #000000170 from 5/17/23 - Status: "Canceled"
- Order #000000180 from 3/11/23 - Status: "Complete"

The task asks for the "latest processing order." Looking at the list, I need to identify which order is currently "processing." However, I see statuses like "Pending", "Canceled", and "Complete" but no explicit "Processing" status visible on this page.

The most recent order is #000000194 with Order Total: $173.56 and Status: Pending (from 10/26/25).

However, to understand what "processing" means in this system, let me click on one of the recent orders to see more details. Let me check the most recent order:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'View Order link for order number 000000194 in the first row'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The page is loading. Let me wait for it to complete:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I can see the order details for Order #000000194. The status shows "Pending" and the order date is October 26, 2025. I can see:

- Subtotal: $158.56
- Shipping & Handling: $15.00
- **Grand Total: $173.56**

This order has a "Pending" status. However, the task asks for the "latest processing order." Let me scroll down to see if there's more information about the order status or if there's a "Processing" designation:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good. I can see the complete order information including shipping address, billing address, and payment method. The Grand Total is clearly shown as **$173.56**.

However, this order shows status "Pending" at the top of the page. The task asks for the "latest processing order." Let me go back to the orders list to check if there might be other orders with a different status. Let me navigate back:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'My Orders link in the left sidebar navigation'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Let me use the browser's back button to go back to the orders list:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'keys': ['alt', 'arrowLeft']}
[result] Keys pressed successfully
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608'}
[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I'm back at the orders list. Looking at the statuses, I can see:
- Multiple orders with "Pending" status
- One order with "Canceled" status (000000170)
- One order with "Complete" status (000000180)

I notice that in e-commerce systems, "Pending" often means the order is being processed. However, let me check if there are more pages or if I need to look for a specific "Processing" status. Let me scroll down to see if there are additional orders or status options:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'short'}
[result] Scrolled down by short distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see at the bottom it says "Items 1 to 10 of 42 total" and there are pagination links (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). Let me check the other pages to see if there's an order with "Processing" status. Let me click on page 2:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'Page number 2 link in the pagination at the bottom'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Let me wait for the page to load:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see I'm now on page 3 (URL shows "?p=3") and this shows "Items 21 to 30 of 42 total". I see mostly "Complete" status orders and one "Canceled" order here. Let me go back to page 1 to look more carefully. Actually, looking at the URL, I accidentally clicked on page 3. Let me think about what "processing order" might mean in this context.

In e-commerce, "Pending" status typically means an order is being processed (payment received, being prepared for shipment). Since the task asks for the "latest processing order" and the most recent order (#000000194 from 10/26/25) has a "Pending" status with a total of $173.56, this is likely the answer.

However, let me go back to page 1 and check if there's a way to filter by order status or if there's actually a "Processing" status distinct from "Pending":
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'Page number 1 link in the pagination'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The page is loading. Let me wait:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I'm back on page 1. Looking at the orders, I can see three distinct status types:
1. **Pending** - Multiple orders from 10/26/25 and 5/2/23
2. **Canceled** - Order #000000170 from 5/17/23
3. **Complete** - Order #000000180 from 3/11/23

In e-commerce systems, "Pending" typically means an order is currently being processed (awaiting fulfillment). The most recent order with "Pending" status is Order #000000194 dated 10/26/25 (today) with an Order Total of **$173.56**.

However, let me check one more of the "Pending" orders to see if there's any additional detail that specifically says "Processing" within the order details. Let me check order #000000190 which also has "Pending" status:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'View Order link for order number 000000190'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Let me wait for the page to load:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I can see Order #000000190 details. It also shows "Pending" status and Order Date: October 26, 2025. Let me scroll down to see the total cost for this order:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I can see Order #000000190 also has "Pending" status with:
- Subtotal: $1,040.96
- Shipping & Handling: $35.00
- **Grand Total: $1,075.96**

So far I've seen several orders with "Pending" status from 10/26/25. The task asks for "the latest processing order." In e-commerce terminology, "Pending" typically means the order is being processed. 

Looking at the order list, all orders from 10/26/25 with "Pending" status are:
1. Order #000000194 - $173.56 (most recent order number)
2. Order #000000193 - $18.98
3. Order #000000192 - $528.34
4. Order #000000191 - $255.80
5. Order #000000190 - $1,075.96

Since Order #000000194 has the highest order number and the same date (10/26/25), it is the **latest** order. Let me scroll up on this page to confirm the status label at the top:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'long'}
[result] Scrolled up by long distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see Order #000000190 clearly shows "Pending" status at the top. Now, based on my analysis:

- The system shows three status types: "Pending", "Canceled", and "Complete"
- "Pending" appears to be the status used for orders that are currently being processed
- The most recent order (highest order number) is #000000194 with "Pending" status
- Order #000000194 has a Grand Total of **$173.56**

Since "Pending" is the status used in this system for orders being processed, and Order #000000194 is the latest (most recent order number from today's date 10/26/25), the answer to "the total cost of my latest processing order" is **$173.56**.
[tool] mcp__task-completion__complete_task: {'finalAnswer': '$173.56'}
[complete] $173.56
Perfect! I found the total cost of the latest processing order. The answer is **$173.56** for Order #000000194, which is the most recent order with "Pending" (processing) status dated October 26, 2025.</pre></div><div class='action_object' style='background-color:grey'><pre>{'action_type': <ActionTypes.STOP: 17>, 'coords': array([0., 0.], dtype=float32), 'element_role': 0, 'element_name': '', 'text': [], 'page_number': 0, 'url': '', 'nth': 0, 'pw_code': '', 'element_id': '', 'key_comb': '', 'direction': '', 'answer': '$173.56', 'raw_prediction': 'I\'ll help you find the total cost of your latest processing order.

Let me navigate back:\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'target\': \'My Orders link in the left sidebar navigation\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nLet me use the browser\'s back button to go back to the orders list:\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'keys\': [\'alt\', \'arrowLeft\']}\n[result] Keys pressed successfully\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\'}\n[result] {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood! I\'m back at the orders list. Looking at the statuses, I can see:\n- Multiple orders with "Pending" status\n- One order with "Canceled" status (000000170)\n- One order with "Complete" status (000000180)\n\nI notice that in e-commerce systems, "Pending" often means the order is being processed. However, let me check if there are more pages or if I need to look for a specific "Processing" status. Let me scroll down to see if there are additional orders or status options:\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'direction\': \'down\', \'distance\': \'short\'}\n[result] Scrolled down by short distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI can see at the bottom it says "Items 1 to 10 of 42 total" and there are pagination links (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). Let me check the other pages to see if there\'s an order with "Processing" status. Let me click on page 2:\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'target\': \'Page number 2 link in the pagination at the bottom\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nLet me wait for the page to load:\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'duration\': 2000}\n[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI can see I\'m now on page 3 (URL shows "?p=3") and this shows "Items 21 to 30 of 42 total". I see mostly "Complete" status orders and one "Canceled" order here. Let me go back to page 1 to look more carefully. Actually, looking at the URL, I accidentally clicked on page 3. Let me think about what "processing order" might mean in this context.\n\nIn e-commerce, "Pending" status typically means an order is being processed (payment received, being prepared for shipment). Since the task asks for the "latest processing order" and the most recent order (#000000194 from 10/26/25) has a "Pending" status with a total of $173.56, this is likely the answer.\n\nHowever, let me go back to page 1 and check if there\'s a way to filter by order status or if there\'s actually a "Processing" status distinct from "Pending":\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'target\': \'Page number 1 link in the pagination\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nThe page is loading. Let me wait:\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'duration\': 2000}\n[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect! I\'m back on page 1. Looking at the orders, I can see three distinct status types:\n1. **Pending** - Multiple orders from 10/26/25 and 5/2/23\n2. **Canceled** - Order #000000170 from 5/17/23\n3. **Complete** - Order #000000180 from 3/11/23\n\nIn e-commerce systems, "Pending" typically means an order is currently being processed (awaiting fulfillment). The most recent order with "Pending" status is Order #000000194 dated 10/26/25 (today) with an Order Total of **$173.56**.\n\nHowever, let me check one more of the "Pending" orders to see if there\'s any additional detail that specifically says "Processing" within the order details. Let me check order #000000190 which also has "Pending" status:\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'target\': \'View Order link for order number 000000190\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nLet me wait for the page to load:\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'duration\': 2000}\n[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood! I can see Order #000000190 details. It also shows "Pending" status and Order Date: October 26, 2025. Let me scroll down to see the total cost for this order:\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'direction\': \'down\', \'distance\': \'medium\'}\n[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect! I can see Order #000000190 also has "Pending" status with:\n- Subtotal: $1,040.96\n- Shipping & Handling: $35.00\n- **Grand Total: $1,075.96**\n\nSo far I\'ve seen several orders with "Pending" status from 10/26/25. The task asks for "the latest processing order." In e-commerce terminology, "Pending" typically means the order is being processed. \n\nLooking at the order list, all orders from 10/26/25 with "Pending" status are:\n1. Order #000000194 - $173.56 (most recent order number)\n2. Order #000000193 - $18.98\n3. Order #000000192 - $528.34\n4. Order #000000191 - $255.80\n5. Order #000000190 - $1,075.96\n\nSince Order #000000194 has the highest order number and the same date (10/26/25), it is the **latest** order. Let me scroll up on this page to confirm the status label at the top:\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'direction\': \'up\', \'distance\': \'long\'}\n[result] Scrolled up by long distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI can see Order #000000190 clearly shows "Pending" status at the top. Now, based on my analysis:\n\n- The system shows three status types: "Pending", "Canceled", and "Complete"\n- "Pending" appears to be the status used for orders that are currently being processed\n- The most recent order (highest order number) is #000000194 with "Pending" status\n- Order #000000194 has a Grand Total of **$173.56**\n\nSince "Pending" is the status used in this system for orders being processed, and Order #000000194 is the latest (most recent order number from today\'s date 10/26/25), the answer to "the total cost of my latest processing order" is **$173.56**.\n[tool] mcp__task-completion__complete_task: {\'finalAnswer\': \'$173.56\'}\n[complete] $173.56\nPerfect! I found the total cost of the latest processing order. The answer is **$173.56** for Order #000000194, which is the most recent order with "Pending" (processing) status dated October 26, 2025.'}</pre></div><div class='parsed_action' style='background-color:yellow'><pre>stop [$173.56]</pre></div></div>
