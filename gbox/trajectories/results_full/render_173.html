[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__list_tabs: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c'}

      "loading": false
I can see there are 2 tabs open. One is a CDP URL page (New Tab) that I should not interact with, and the other is a GitLab Dashboard. Let me switch to the GitLab tab and take a screenshot to see the current state.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__switch_tab: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'tabId': '2'}
[result] Switched to tab 2 successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I'm now on the GitLab Dashboard showing a list of projects. I need to find and open my latest updated issue that has the keyword "better" in its title to check if it's closed. 

To access issues, I need to navigate to the Issues section. I can see there's a navigation menu at the top. Let me look for the Issues link or use the search functionality. I'll click on the hamburger menu icon on the left to see the full navigation.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Hamburger menu icon with three horizontal lines in the top left corner next to the GitLab logo'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The menu doesn't seem to have opened. Let me try a different approach. I notice in the top navigation bar there should be an "Issues" link. Let me look for the navigation options. I can see various icons in the top right. Let me check if there's a direct way to access issues. I'll look for the issues icon in the top navigation bar.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c'}
[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see I'm on the GitLab Projects Dashboard. To find issues with "better" in the title, I need to navigate to the Issues section. Let me click on the Issues icon in the top navigation bar - I can see there's a checkmark icon with a badge showing "13" next to other navigation icons in the top right.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Checkmark icon with badge showing number 13 in the top navigation bar'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I can see the URL has changed to include "dashboard/issues?assignee_username=byteblaze" which means I'm navigating to the issues section. However, the page still shows the Projects view. Let me wait a moment for the page to load.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'duration': 1000}
[result] Finished waiting for 1000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I'm now on the Issues page. I can see there are issues listed, and I can see at the bottom of the visible list there's an issue titled "Better initial load experience" which contains the keyword "better" in its title. 

I need to:
1. Find the latest updated issue with "better" in the title
2. Check if it's closed

Looking at the current view, I can see "Better initial load experience" at the bottom. However, I need to check if there are more issues with "better" in the title by scrolling down, and I also need to identify which one is the "latest updated" one. Let me scroll down to see if there are more issues.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! Now I can see two issues with "better" in the title:
1. "Better initial load experience" - updated 2 years ago
2. "Better sharing solution" - updated 2 years ago

Both were updated 2 years ago. Let me continue scrolling to see if there are more issues with "better" in the title.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the same issues. It appears the page isn't scrolling further, which means I've reached the end of the list. I can see two issues with "better" in the title:

1. "Better initial load experience" - updated 2 years ago
2. "Better sharing solution" - updated 2 years ago

Both show "updated 2 years ago". However, I notice the issues are currently sorted by "Created date" (as shown in the dropdown at the top right). To find the "latest updated" issue with "better" in the title, I should sort by "Updated date" instead. Let me scroll back up to access the sort dropdown.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled up by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! Now I can see the sort dropdown. I can see "Created date" with a dropdown arrow in the top right. Let me click on it to change the sort order to "Updated date" so I can identify the latest updated issue with "better" in the title.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Created date dropdown button in the top right area of the issues list'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! A dropdown menu has appeared with various sort options. I can see "Updated date" in the list. Let me click on it to sort the issues by update date.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Updated date option in the dropdown menu'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I can see the sort has changed to "Updated date" (shown in the dropdown button). Now the list is sorted by updated date. Let me wait for the page to fully load and then look for issues with "better" in the title.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'duration': 1000}
[result] Finished waiting for 1000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now the list is sorted by "Updated date" (I can see the URL includes "sort=updated_desc"). Looking at the visible issues, I can see two issues with "better" in their titles:

1. "Better initial load experience" - updated 2 years ago
2. "Better sharing solution" - updated 2 years ago

Both show the same update time "updated 2 years ago". Since they appear to have the same relative update time, I need to look more carefully. The issue "Better initial load experience" appears first in the list when sorted by updated date (descending), which means it's the most recently updated one with "better" in the title.

However, looking at both issues, I notice they both have status labels. Let me look at the current visible issues more carefully:
- "Better initial load experience" has labels: [Priority] Low, [Status] Submitted, [Type] Enhancement
- "Better sharing solution" has labels: [Priority] Medium, [Status] Submitted, [Type] Enhancement

Neither of these appears to be closed. Let me click on "Better initial load experience" to check its full status since it's the first one in the updated list.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Better initial load experience issue link'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the URL has changed to "/byteblaze/empathy-prompts/-/issues/8" which suggests I'm navigating to an issue page. However, the page still shows the issues list. Let me wait for the page to fully load.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I can now see the issue page for "Better initial load experience". Looking at the key information:

**Title:** Better initial load experience

**Status:** I can see a green badge that says "Open" near the top of the page, right after the project breadcrumb. This clearly indicates the issue is **OPEN**, not closed.

The issue shows:
- Status: Open (green badge)
- Labels: [Priority] Low, [Status] Submitted, [Type] Enhancement
- Lock issue: Unlocked

This is the latest updated issue with "better" in the title (as it appeared first when sorted by updated date descending), and it is **NOT closed** - it is **OPEN**.
[tool] mcp__task-completion__complete_task: {'finalAnswer': 'No, the issue is not closed. The latest updated issue with "better" in the title is "Better initial load experience" and its status is Open.'}
[complete] No, the issue is not closed. The latest updated issue with "better" in the title is "Better initial load experience" and its status is Open.
The task is complete. I found the latest updated issue with the keyword "better" in its title, which is "Better initial load experience", and verified that it is **not closed** - it has an "Open" status.</pre></div><div class='action_object' style='background-color:grey'><pre>{'action_type': <ActionTypes.STOP: 17>, 'coords': array([0., 0.], dtype=float32), 'element_role': 0, 'element_name': '', 'text': [], 'page_number': 0, 'url': '', 'nth': 0, 'pw_code': '', 'element_id': '', 'key_comb': '', 'direction': '', 'answer': 'No, the issue is not closed.
