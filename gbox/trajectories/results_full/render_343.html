Good! I can see I'm on a GitLab repository page for "metaseq". I can see in the left sidebar that there are "Issues" with a count of "95". I need to navigate to the Issues section to find all opened issues without labels. Let me click on the Issues link.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': 'Issues link with count 95 in the left sidebar navigation menu'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I see a dropdown menu has appeared with options "List", "Boards", "Service Desk", and "Milestones". I need to click on "List" to see the issues list.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': 'List option in the dropdown menu below Issues'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I'm now on the Issues page. I can see there are 95 open issues. I can see various issues with different labels like "enhancement", "bug", "question", "better-eng", "good first issue". 

I need to filter the issues to show only those without any labels. Let me look for a filter option. I can see there's a search/filter bar at the top. Let me use it to filter for issues with no labels. In GitLab, I can use the filter to exclude labeled issues.

Let me scroll down first to see more issues and get a better sense of which ones don't have labels, or I can try using the filter functionality.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': 'Search or filter results input field with placeholder text'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Great! A dropdown menu has appeared with filter options including "Assignee", "Author", "Confidential", "Label", "Milestone", "My-Reaction", "Release", "Search Within", and "Type". I need to click on "Label" to filter by labels.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': 'Label option in the dropdown filter menu'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I can see the filter now shows "Label" and there's a dropdown showing "is" and "is not" options. I need to select "is not" or look for a "None" option to filter for issues without labels. Let me take a screenshot to see the full dropdown menu.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502'}
[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see there's a dropdown showing "is" and "is not" options. In GitLab, to filter for issues without labels, I typically need to use "Label = None". Let me click on the dropdown where it shows "is" to see if there's a "None" option or I need to type something specific.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': 'dropdown showing is and is not options in the label filter'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the filter now shows "Label is=" and there's an input field. I need to type "None" to filter for issues without any labels. Let me type "None" in this field.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'content': 'None', 'pressEnterAfterType': True}
[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I notice the URL has changed to include "undefined=None" which suggests the filter might not have worked as expected. The issues still show labels. Let me try a different approach. I'll clear this filter and try using the search field directly. Let me click on the X or clear button to reset the filter.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': 'X icon or clear button in the filter area to reset the filter'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I see a tooltip appeared. Let me try a different approach. In GitLab, I should use the search syntax directly. Let me click on the search field and type the filter syntax for issues with no labels.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': 'Search or filter results input field with placeholder text'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good, the dropdown menu appeared again. Let me click on "Label" this time.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': 'Label option in the dropdown filter menu'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the filter now shows "Label" with options "is" and "is not". Let me look for a "None" option. I should check if there's a special option for "None" in the dropdown. Let me wait a moment and see if options appear, or I'll need to scroll down in the dropdown to find "None".
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502'}
[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Let me try a different approach. Instead of using the filter dropdown, let me manually scroll through all the issues to identify which ones don't have labels. First, let me scroll down to see more issues and note which ones don't have any label badges.

Looking at the current visible issues, I can see most have labels, but I need to systematically check all 95 open issues. Let me scroll down to see more.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Great! I can see more issues now. I notice:
- Issue #596 "Fine-tune and collect data for fine-tuning OPT models" - this one appears to have NO labels!

I can also see at the bottom there's pagination showing "Show 20 items" and navigation buttons. Let me continue scrolling to check all issues on this page, and then I'll need to go through all pages. But wait, this manual approach will take too long with 95 issues.

Let me try a better approach - I'll directly edit the URL to add the proper filter parameter. Let me click on the address bar and modify the URL.

Actually, let me try clicking in the empty space after "Label" in the filter to see if there's an input field where I can type.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'long'}
[result] Scrolled up by long distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can still see "Label" in the filter. Let me try clicking on the input area after "Label" to see what options appear. Let me click directly after the "Label" text where it seems to expect input.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': 'empty input area immediately after the Label text in the filter bar'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Let me try a more direct approach. I'll modify the URL directly to add the proper filter. Let me click on the address bar and change the URL to include the correct label filter parameter.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': 'URL address bar at the top of the browser'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! The URL is now selected. I can see it already has "&undefined=None" in it. Let me clear this and type a proper URL with the correct filter parameter. In GitLab, the correct parameter for filtering by no labels should be "label_name[]=None" or similar.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'content': 'ec2-3-149-78-74.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8023/root/metaseq/-/issues?sort=updated_desc&state=opened&label_name[]=None', 'pressEnterAfterType': True}
[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I see the URL now shows "&label_name[]=None" but the page still shows all issues with labels. The filter didn't work as expected. Let me try a different approach - I'll use the search syntax directly in the search field. Let me clear the search bar and type a filter query.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': 'Search or filter results input field below the Open/Closed/All tabs'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! The filter worked! I can now see that it's showing "Label = ~None" in the filter bar, and the issue count has changed to show "Open 5" instead of "Open 95"! 

I can see there are **5 open issues** without any labels:

1. **#596** - "Fine-tune and collect data for f..." (created 2 years ago)
2. **#470** - "Data processing details in pretr..." (created 2 years ago)
3. **#319** - "Host logbooks outside of Githu..." (created 3 years ago)
4. **#238** - "Release Planning" (created 3 years ago)
5. **#13** - "Validate args to prevent Runtim..." (partially visible, appears to be about "Validate args to prevent Runtime error, block == 0", created 3 years ago)

Let me scroll down to see if there are more issues and to see the complete title of issue #13.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'short'}
[result] Scrolled down by short distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Let me close this dropdown menu by pressing Escape so I can see the issues more clearly.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'keys': ['escape']}
[result] Keys pressed successfully

Let me click somewhere else to close the dropdown menu.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': 'Issues heading text in the breadcrumb navigation'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I can see all 5 open issues without any labels clearly:

1. **#596** - "Fine-tune and collect data for fine-tuning OPT models" (created 2 years ago by Administrator, updated 2 years ago)

2. **#470** - "Data processing details in pretraining" (created 2 years ago by Administrator, updated 2 years ago)

3. **#319** - "Host logbooks outside of Github" (created 3 years ago by Administrator, updated 3 years ago)

4. **#238** - "Release Planning" (created 3 years ago by Administrator, updated 3 years ago)

5. **#13** - "Validate args to prevent RuntimeError: attn_batches % batches_per_block == 0" (created 3 years ago by Administrator, updated 3 years ago)

The filter shows "Open 5" which confirms there are exactly 5 open issues without any labels. Now I can provide the complete answer.

Let me click on "Label" this time.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502\', \'target\': \'Label option in the dropdown filter menu\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI can see the filter now shows "Label" with options "is" and "is not". Let me look for a "None" option. I should check if there\'s a special option for "None" in the dropdown. Let me wait a moment and see if options appear, or I\'ll need to scroll down in the dropdown to find "None".\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {\'boxId\': \'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502\'}\n[result] {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nLet me try a different approach. Instead of using the filter dropdown, let me manually scroll through all the issues to identify which ones don\'t have labels. First, let me scroll down to see more issues and note which ones don\'t have any label badges.\n\nLooking at the current visible issues, I can see most have labels, but I need to systematically check all 95 open issues. Let me scroll down to see more.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502\', \'direction\': \'down\', \'distance\': \'medium\'}\n[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGreat! I can see more issues now. I notice:\n- Issue #596 "Fine-tune and collect data for fine-tuning OPT models" - this one appears to have NO labels!\n\nI can also see at the bottom there\'s pagination showing "Show 20 items" and navigation buttons. Let me continue scrolling to check all issues on this page, and then I\'ll need to go through all pages. But wait, this manual approach will take too long with 95 issues.\n\nLet me try a better approach - I\'ll directly edit the URL to add the proper filter parameter. Let me click on the address bar and modify the URL.\n\nActually, let me try clicking in the empty space after "Label" in the filter to see if there\'s an input field where I can type.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502\', \'direction\': \'up\', \'distance\': \'long\'}\n[result] Scrolled up by long distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI can still see "Label" in the filter. Let me try clicking on the input area after "Label" to see what options appear. Let me click directly after the "Label" text where it seems to expect input.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502\', \'target\': \'empty input area immediately after the Label text in the filter bar\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nLet me try a more direct approach. I\'ll modify the URL directly to add the proper filter. Let me click on the address bar and change the URL to include the correct label filter parameter.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502\', \'target\': \'URL address bar at the top of the browser\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood! The URL is now selected. I can see it already has "&undefined=None" in it. Let me clear this and type a proper URL with the correct filter parameter. In GitLab, the correct parameter for filtering by no labels should be "label_name[]=None" or similar.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {\'boxId\': \'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502\', \'content\': \'ec2-3-149-78-74.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8023/root/metaseq/-/issues?sort=updated_desc&state=opened&label_name[]=None\', \'pressEnterAfterType\': True}\n[result] Text typed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI see the URL now shows "&label_name[]=None" but the page still shows all issues with labels. The filter didn\'t work as expected. Let me try a different approach - I\'ll use the search syntax directly in the search field. Let me clear the search bar and type a filter query.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502\', \'target\': \'Search or filter results input field below the Open/Closed/All tabs\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nExcellent! The filter worked! I can now see that it\'s showing "Label = ~None" in the filter bar, and the issue count has changed to show "Open 5" instead of "Open 95"! \n\nI can see there are **5 open issues** without any labels:\n\n1. **#596** - "Fine-tune and collect data for f..." (created 2 years ago)\n2. **#470** - "Data processing details in pretr..." (created 2 years ago)\n3. **#319** - "Host logbooks outside of Githu..." (created 3 years ago)\n4. **#238** - "Release Planning" (created 3 years ago)\n5. **#13** - "Validate args to prevent Runtim..." (partially visible, appears to be about "Validate args to prevent Runtime error, block == 0", created 3 years ago)\n\nLet me scroll down to see if there are more issues and to see the complete title of issue #13.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502\', \'direction\': \'down\', \'distance\': \'short\'}\n[result] Scrolled down by short distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nLet me close this dropdown menu by pressing Escape so I can see the issues more clearly.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {\'boxId\': \'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502\', \'keys\': [\'escape\']}\n[result] Keys pressed successfully\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {\'boxId\': \'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502\'}\n[result] {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nLet me click somewhere else to close the dropdown menu.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502\', \'target\': \'Issues heading text in the breadcrumb navigation\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect! Now I can see all 5 open issues without any labels clearly:\n\n1. **#596** - "Fine-tune and collect data for fine-tuning OPT models" (created 2 years ago by Administrator, updated 2 years ago)\n\n2. **#470** - "Data processing details in pretraining" (created 2 years ago by Administrator, updated 2 years ago)\n\n3. **#319** - "Host logbooks outside of Github" (created 3 years ago by Administrator, updated 3 years ago)\n\n4. **#238** - "Release Planning" (created 3 years ago by Administrator, updated 3 years ago)\n\n5. **#13** - "Validate args to prevent RuntimeError: attn_batches % batches_per_block == 0" (created 3 years ago by Administrator, updated 3 years ago)\n\nThe filter shows "Open 5" which confirms there are exactly 5 open issues without any labels. Now I can provide the complete answer.\n[tool] mcp__task-completion__complete_task: {\'finalAnswer\': \'#596: Fine-tune and collect data for fine-tuning OPT models\\n#470: Data processing details in pretraining\\n#319: Host logbooks outside of Github\\n#238: Release Planning\\n#13: Validate args to prevent RuntimeError: attn_batches % batches_per_block == 0\'}\n[complete] #596: Fine-tune and collect data for fine-tuning OPT models\\n#470: Data processing details in pretraining\\n#319: Host logbooks outside of Github\\n#238: Release Planning\\n#13: Validate args to prevent RuntimeError: attn_batches % batches_per_block == 0\nTask complete!
