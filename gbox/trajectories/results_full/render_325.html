Good! I can see that I'm on the "One Stop Market" website (tab 2 is already active based on the screenshot). This is an e-commerce site with various product categories. I need to search for "mouth night guard" products and sort them by descending price.

Let me use the search bar at the top of the page to search for "mouth night guard":
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': 'Search bar with placeholder text "Search entire store here..."'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good, the search bar is now focused. Let me type "mouth night guard" to search for these products:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'content': 'mouth night guard', 'pressEnterAfterType': True}
[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the page is loading (the tab shows a loading indicator). Let me wait a moment for the search results to load:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! The search results are now displayed. I can see:
- "Search results for: 'mouth night guard'"
- Items 1-12 of 9819 results
- There's a "Sort By" dropdown currently set to "Relevance"
- I can see several products displayed including retainer cleaners and night guards

I need to change the sorting from "Relevance" to price descending. Let me click on the "Sort By" dropdown:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': 'Sort By dropdown menu showing "Relevance"'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! The dropdown is now open and I can see the sorting options:
- Product Name
- Price
- Relevance (currently selected)

I need to click on "Price" to sort by price:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': 'Price option in the Sort By dropdown menu'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I can see the page is loading (the tab shows a loading indicator) and the dropdown now shows "Price" selected. However, I need to make sure it's sorted by descending price (highest to lowest). Let me wait for the page to load and then check if there's a way to change the sort order:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! The page has reloaded and I can see the results are now sorted by price. I can see the URL has changed to include `&product_list_order=price`. I notice there's an up/down arrow icon next to the "Sort By" dropdown (↓) which likely controls ascending vs descending order. 

Looking at the products shown, they appear to be expensive furniture items (beds, sofas), which suggests these are high-priced items. This is good - it means they might already be sorted in descending order (highest to lowest). Let me scroll down to see the prices and verify the sort order:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'short'}
[result] Scrolled down by short distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the prices now, but I notice these products don't seem to be "mouth night guard" items - they're showing beds, sofas, night vision goggles, and TVs. The prices I can see are:
- $28,283.99
- $28,269.99
- $11,083.35
- $8,139.32
- $7,739.22
- $7,149.00
- $6,202.33
- $5,462.95

The prices are decreasing, which suggests the items are already sorted in descending order (highest to lowest price first). However, these are NOT mouth night guard products. Let me scroll back up to check if there's an issue with the search results or if I need to look at the arrow icon to confirm the sort direction:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled up by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the page now and notice that there's a downward arrow (↓) next to the Sort By dropdown. The search is for "mouth night guard" but the results are showing furniture items (beds, sofas) which are the most expensive items. The prices I can see are:
- $28,283.99
- $28,269.99
- $11,083.35
- $8,139.32

This suggests the sorting is currently in descending order (highest to lowest). However, I notice that the search results include 9819 items, and the site is showing items that contain any of the search terms. I should look for the actual "mouth night guard" items. Let me click on the downward arrow to see if it changes to ascending order first, to understand the sort direction:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': 'Downward arrow icon next to the Sort By dropdown showing Price'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The page seems to be loading (I can see a loading bar at the bottom). Let me wait for it to finish loading:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! Now the sorting has changed to ascending order (lowest to highest). I can see the URL now contains `&product_list_dir=asc`. The products shown are now much cheaper items like Bluetooth speakers, eyeshadow, kids toothbrush, and nail cleaner.

I need to change back to descending order (highest to lowest) by clicking the arrow again:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': 'Upward arrow icon next to the Sort By dropdown showing Price'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the page is loading (there's a loading bar at the bottom). Let me wait for it to finish:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I'm back to descending order (highest to lowest). I can see the URL no longer has `&product_list_dir=asc`, which confirms it's in descending order. The expensive furniture items (beds, sofas) are showing again at the top.

However, I need to show the actual "mouth night guard" listings, not these unrelated expensive items. The search is returning 9819 items because it's matching any of the words "mouth", "night", or "guard". I should use the related search term "mouth guard" link I saw earlier to get more specific results. Let me scroll down a bit to see if there are actual mouth night guard products visible, or I should click on the "mouth guard" related search term:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the products are still expensive items (beds, night vision goggles, TVs) ranging from $28,283.99 down to $5,462.95. The search results contain the word "night" (like "Night Vision" and "Sleeper Sofa") but these aren't mouth guards. 

The issue is that the search is too broad - it's matching any items containing "mouth", "night", OR "guard". I need to search more specifically. Let me scroll back up and try clicking on the "mouth guard" related search term to narrow down the results:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'long'}
[result] Scrolled up by long distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I can see the "Related search terms" section with "mouth guard" as one of the options. However, I realize that I need to think about this differently. The task asks me to "show the mouth night guard listings by descending price" - which means I should display/present the current results that are already sorted by descending price.

Looking at the current state:
- The search is for "mouth night guard"
- The results are sorted by Price in descending order (9819 items)
- Items 1-12 are currently displayed

The results ARE already showing mouth night guard listings sorted by descending price. The fact that beds and furniture appear at the top is because the search engine is matching items that contain ANY of these words and showing the most expensive matches first. 

However, to truly show "mouth night guard" products specifically, I should use the more specific search term. Let me click on "mouth guard" to get more relevant results:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': 'mouth guard link in Related search terms section'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the page is loading (there's a loading bar at the bottom). Let me wait for it to load:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! Now I have much more relevant results! The search has changed to "mouth guard" and shows 3201 items. I can see actual mouth guard products:
- ZUDULUT mouth guard storage
- Boxing Mouth Guard ($14.09)
- EXCEART Denture Case
- Reazeal Mouth Guard for Grinding Teeth, Night Guards

However, I notice the sorting has reset to "Relevance". I need to change it back to "Price" and ensure it's in descending order. Let me click on the Sort By dropdown:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': 'Sort By dropdown menu showing Relevance'}
[error] Error: 500 Internal server error (HTTP 500)
Details: {
  "statusCode": 500,
  "message": "Internal server error"
}
Let me try again:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502'}
[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good, the page is still showing the mouth guard results. Let me try clicking on the dropdown again to change the sort order:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': 'Relevance dropdown in the Sort By section'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! The dropdown is now open. I can see:
- Product Name
- Price
- Relevance (currently selected)

Let me click on "Price":
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': 'Price option in the dropdown menu'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I can see the page is loading (there's a loading indicator). The dropdown now shows "Price" selected. Let me wait for the page to reload with the price-sorted results:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the URL now contains `&product_list_order=price` which indicates it's sorting by price. However, the items shown are expensive items that aren't mouth guards (Samsung TV, copper dragon ornaments, furniture, mattresses). The prices I can see are:
- $5,097.62
- $2,158.00
- $1,999.99

These prices appear to be in descending order. However, I'm concerned that the search results for "mouth guard" are including many items that just contain the word "guard" (like "Surface-Guard" mattress). 

Let me check if there's a way to see if the sort is truly descending by looking at the arrow icon, and then scroll down to see more products:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see more products with prices:
- $7,149.00 (TV)
- $1,659.99 (furniture)
- $1,637.97 (mattress with Surface-Guard)
- $1,599.00 (mattress)
- $1,553.37 (bed)

The prices are continuing to decrease, confirming the descending order. However, these are still furniture items containing "guard" in their names, not actual mouth guards. The original task asked for "mouth night guard" listings, but the "mouth guard" search is too broad as well.

Let me go back to the original "mouth night guard" search by clicking on the related search term link. Let me scroll back up first:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'long'}
[result] Scrolled up by long distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I can see the "mouth night guard" link in the Related search terms section. Let me click on it to go back to the more specific search:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': 'mouth night guard link in the Related search terms section'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the page is loading (there's a loading bar at the bottom). Let me wait for it to finish:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I'm back to the "mouth night guard" search with 9819 items. I can see actual mouth guard related products:
- Retainer & Denture Cleaner Tablets - 4 Months Supply (120 pcs)
- Retainer Cleaner & Denture Cleanser - 180 Effervescent Tablets
- 2 Pack Retainer Case Orthodontic Retainer Holder Cases with Vent
- BESPORTBLE 2 Pcs Night Guard Dental Night Protector Dental Guard

However, the sort is back to "Relevance". I need to change it to "Price" again and make sure it's in descending order. Let me click on the Sort By dropdown:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': 'Relevance dropdown menu in the Sort By section'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! The dropdown is open. Let me click on "Price":
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': 'Price option in the dropdown menu'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The page is loading. Let me wait for it to complete:

[result] Finished waiting for 2500ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! The page has loaded and I can see:
- Search results for: 'mouth night guard'
- Items 1-12 of 9819
- Sort By: Price (with a downward arrow ↓)
- URL contains: `&product_list_order=price`

The products shown are the expensive furniture items (beds, sofas) again, which suggests the sorting is in descending order (highest prices first). However, I notice that by default when you select "Price", it might be sorting in ascending order. Let me scroll down to check the prices and confirm the sort direction:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'short'}
[result] Scrolled down by short distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! I can now see the prices clearly:
- $28,283.99
- $28,269.99
- $11,083.35
- $8,139.32
- $7,739.22
- $7,149.00
- $6,202.33
- $5,462.95

The prices are in DESCENDING order (highest to lowest), which is exactly what the task requested! The products are sorted by descending price as required. The listings include items that match the search terms "mouth", "night", and "guard" (like "Night Vision" goggles, furniture with "night" in the name, etc.), and they are properly sorted from highest to lowest price.

Now I have successfully completed the task. The "mouth night guard" search results are displayed and sorted by descending price. Let me complete the task:
[tool] mcp__task-completion__complete_task: {'finalAnswer': 'The "mouth night guard" listings are now displayed and sorted by descending price.

I can see the page is loading (the tab shows a loading indicator) and the dropdown now shows "Price" selected. However, I need to make sure it\'s sorted by descending price (highest to lowest). Let me wait for the page to load and then check if there\'s a way to change the sort order:\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {\'boxId\': \'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502\', \'duration\': 2000}\n[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect! The page has reloaded and I can see the results are now sorted by price. I can see the URL has changed to include `&product_list_order=price`. I notice there\'s an up/down arrow icon next to the "Sort By" dropdown (↓) which likely controls ascending vs descending order. \n\nLooking at the products shown, they appear to be expensive furniture items (beds, sofas), which suggests these are high-priced items. This is good - it means they might already be sorted in descending order (highest to lowest). Let me scroll down to see the prices and verify the sort order:\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502\', \'direction\': \'down\', \'distance\': \'short\'}\n[result] Scrolled down by short distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI can see the prices now, but I notice these products don\'t seem to be "mouth night guard" items - they\'re showing beds, sofas, night vision goggles, and TVs. The prices I can see are:\n- $28,283.99\n- $28,269.99\n- $11,083.35\n- $8,139.32\n- $7,739.22\n- $7,149.00\n- $6,202.33\n- $5,462.95\n\nThe prices are decreasing, which suggests the items are already sorted in descending order (highest to lowest price first). However, these are NOT mouth night guard products. Let me scroll back up to check if there\'s an issue with the search results or if I need to look at the arrow icon to confirm the sort direction:\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502\', \'direction\': \'up\', \'distance\': \'medium\'}\n[result] Scrolled up by medium distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI can see the page now and notice that there\'s a downward arrow (↓) next to the Sort By dropdown. The search is for "mouth night guard" but the results are showing furniture items (beds, sofas) which are the most expensive items. The prices I can see are:\n- $28,283.99\n- $28,269.99\n- $11,083.35\n- $8,139.32\n\nThis suggests the sorting is currently in descending order (highest to lowest). However, I notice that the search results include 9819 items, and the site is showing items that contain any of the search terms. I should look for the actual "mouth night guard" items. Let me click on the downward arrow to see if it changes to ascending order first, to understand the sort direction:\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502\', \'target\': \'Downward arrow icon next to the Sort By dropdown showing Price\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nThe page seems to be loading (I can see a loading bar at the bottom). Let me wait for it to finish loading:\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {\'boxId\': \'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502\', \'duration\': 2000}\n[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood! Now the sorting has changed to ascending order (lowest to highest). I can see the URL now contains `&product_list_dir=asc`. The products shown are now much cheaper items like Bluetooth speakers, eyeshadow, kids toothbrush, and nail cleaner.\n\nI need to change back to descending order (highest to lowest) by clicking the arrow again:\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502\', \'target\': \'Upward arrow icon next to the Sort By dropdown showing Price\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI can see the page is loading (there\'s a loading bar at the bottom).

Now I\'m back to descending order (highest to lowest). I can see the URL no longer has `&product_list_dir=asc`, which confirms it\'s in descending order. The expensive furniture items (beds, sofas) are showing again at the top.\n\nHowever, I need to show the actual "mouth night guard" listings, not these unrelated expensive items. The search is returning 9819 items because it\'s matching any of the words "mouth", "night", or "guard". I should use the related search term "mouth guard" link I saw earlier to get more specific results. Let me scroll down a bit to see if there are actual mouth night guard products visible, or I should click on the "mouth guard" related search term:\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502\', \'direction\': \'down\', \'distance\': \'medium\'}\n[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI can see the products are still expensive items (beds, night vision goggles, TVs) ranging from $28,283.99 down to $5,462.95. The search results contain the word "night" (like "Night Vision" and "Sleeper Sofa") but these aren\'t mouth guards. \n\nThe issue is that the search is too broad - it\'s matching any items containing "mouth", "night", OR "guard". I need to search more specifically. Let me scroll back up and try clicking on the "mouth guard" related search term to narrow down the results:\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502\', \'direction\': \'up\', \'distance\': \'long\'}\n[result] Scrolled up by long distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect! I can see the "Related search terms" section with "mouth guard" as one of the options. However, I realize that I need to think about this differently. The task asks me to "show the mouth night guard listings by descending price" - which means I should display/present the current results that are already sorted by descending price.\n\nLooking at the current state:\n- The search is for "mouth night guard"\n- The results are sorted by Price in descending order (9819 items)\n- Items 1-12 are currently displayed\n\nThe results ARE already showing mouth night guard listings sorted by descending price. The fact that beds and furniture appear at the top is because the search engine is matching items that contain ANY of these words and showing the most expensive matches first. \n\nHowever, to truly show "mouth night guard" products specifically, I should use the more specific search term. Let me click on "mouth guard" to get more relevant results:\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502\', \'target\': \'mouth guard link in Related search terms section\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI can see the page is loading (there\'s a loading bar at the bottom). Let me wait for it to load:\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {\'boxId\': \'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502\', \'duration\': 2000}\n[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nExcellent! Now I have much more relevant results! The search has changed to "mouth guard" and shows 3201 items. I can see actual mouth guard products:\n- ZUDULUT mouth guard storage\n- Boxing Mouth Guard ($14.09)\n- EXCEART Denture Case\n- Reazeal Mouth Guard for Grinding Teeth, Night Guards\n\nHowever, I notice the sorting has reset to "Relevance". I need to change it back to "Price" and ensure it\'s in descending order. Let me click on the Sort By dropdown:\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502\', \'target\': \'Sort By dropdown menu showing Relevance\'}\n[error] Error: 500 Internal server error (HTTP 500)\nDetails: {\n  "statusCode": 500,\n  "message": "Internal server error"\n}\nLet me try again:\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {\'boxId\': \'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502\'}\n[result] {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood, the page is still showing the mouth guard results.

The dropdown is now open. I can see:\n- Product Name\n- Price\n- Relevance (currently selected)\n\nLet me click on "Price":\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502\', \'target\': \'Price option in the dropdown menu\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood! I can see the page is loading (there\'s a loading indicator). The dropdown now shows "Price" selected. Let me wait for the page to reload with the price-sorted results:\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {\'boxId\': \'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502\', \'duration\': 2000}\n[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI can see the URL now contains `&product_list_order=price` which indicates it\'s sorting by price. However, the items shown are expensive items that aren\'t mouth guards (Samsung TV, copper dragon ornaments, furniture, mattresses). The prices I can see are:\n- $5,097.62\n- $2,158.00\n- $1,999.99\n\nThese prices appear to be in descending order. However, I\'m concerned that the search results for "mouth guard" are including many items that just contain the word "guard" (like "Surface-Guard" mattress). \n\nLet me check if there\'s a way to see if the sort is truly descending by looking at the arrow icon, and then scroll down to see more products:\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502\', \'direction\': \'down\', \'distance\': \'medium\'}\n[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI can see more products with prices:\n- $7,149.00 (TV)\n- $1,659.99 (furniture)\n- $1,637.97 (mattress with Surface-Guard)\n- $1,599.00 (mattress)\n- $1,553.37 (bed)\n\nThe prices are continuing to decrease, confirming the descending order. However, these are still furniture items containing "guard" in their names, not actual mouth guards. The original task asked for "mouth night guard" listings, but the "mouth guard" search is too broad as well.\n\nLet me go back to the original "mouth night guard" search by clicking on the related search term link. Let me scroll back up first:\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502\', \'direction\': \'up\', \'distance\': \'long\'}\n[result] Scrolled up by long distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect!

However, I notice that by default when you select "Price", it might be sorting in ascending order.
