I can see there's a Postmill tab open (which appears to be a Reddit-like forum). I'm currently on the New Tab page, but I need to switch to the Postmill tab to find the post about Ted Lasso. Let me switch to that tab.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__switch_tab: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'tabId': '2'}
[result] Switched to tab 2 successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good, I'm now on the Postmill tab. I can see I'm logged in as "MarvelsGrantMan136" (shown in the top right). The page shows "Submissions" and "Comments" tabs. I need to find my post about Ted Lasso. Let me click on the username to access my profile and posts.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'MarvelsGrantMan136 user profile link in the top right navigation bar'}

Perfect! A dropdown menu has appeared with options including "Profile", "My account", "User settings", "Block list", "Dark mode", and "Log out". Let me click on "Profile" to see my posts.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'Profile option in the dropdown menu'}

Good! I'm now on the profile page (URL shows `/user/MarvelsGrantMan136`). I can see the "Submissions" tab is active. The page appears to be loading or the submissions are below the fold. Let me scroll down to see the posts.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}

Excellent! Now I can see a list of submissions. I can see various TV show-related posts, but I need to find the one about "Ted Lasso". Let me continue scrolling to find it.

I can see more posts now. I notice there's a "More" button at the bottom which will load additional posts. I haven't seen the Ted Lasso post yet. Let me click the "More" button to load more submissions.

[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the URL has changed with pagination parameters. The page still shows the same posts, but there's still a "More" button. Let me scroll down to see if new posts have loaded below.

**"'Ted Lasso' Season 3 Premiere Scores 870K U.S. Households, Up 59% From Season 2 Premiere"**

This post has:
- 2 points
- Submitted by MarvelsGrantMan136
- 3 years ago in television
- "No comments" and "Edit" and "Delete" options

Let me click on this post to open it so I can edit the body text.

[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I notice the URL has changed to the Deadline article link (showing the external link opened). The Ted Lasso post title now appears underlined. I need to go back to the Postmill site to edit the post. Let me click the back button or navigate back.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'keys': ['alt', 'arrowLeft']}

Good! I'm back on the profile page. Now I can see the Ted Lasso post. Instead of clicking on the title (which opens the external link), I need to click on the "Edit" link next to the post to edit it. Let me click on the "Edit" link for the Ted Lasso post.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'Edit link next to the Ted Lasso Season 3 Premiere post'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
It seems the page hasn't changed. The edit link might not have been clicked properly. Let me scroll to make sure I can see the Ted Lasso post clearly and then try clicking the Edit link again more precisely.

- With "No comments", "Edit", and "Delete" links below it

Let me click on the "Edit" link for this post.

[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! I can see the page is loading the edit page. The tab title has changed to "Editing submission 'Ted Les..." and the URL shows "/edit" at the end. However, the page content still shows the list. Let me wait a moment for the page to fully load, then take another screenshot.

Perfect! The edit page has loaded. I can see:

I need to click in the Body text area and add the line "Done watching. I love the renew!" Let me click on the Body field.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'Body text area field below the Title field'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! The Body text area is now focused (indicated by the red border around it). Now I can type the required text. Let me type "Done watching. I love the renew!"
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'content': 'Done watching. I love the renew!', 'pressEnterAfterType': False}
[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}

[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Great! I can see that a "Preview" section has appeared showing "Done watching. I love the renew!" This is a preview of how the body text will look. The URL has also changed to show the full post slug. The "Edit submission" button is still visible. Let me click it again to save the changes.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'Edit submission button in red color at the bottom of the form'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the Body field now shows "Done watching. I love the renew!" and the URL has changed back to "/edit". The preview section is no longer visible. The form still shows the edit interface. Let me scroll down to see if there's a save button or if the form needs to be submitted differently.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'short'}

Good! I can see the Preview section again showing "Done watching. I love the renew!" and the "Edit submission" button is visible. It seems the form is showing me a preview before final submission. Let me click the "Edit submission" button one more time to actually save the changes.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'Edit submission red button below the Preview section'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I notice the page is still showing the edit form with the preview. The URL changed to show the full post slug. Let me wait a moment for the page to fully process and then check if it redirects to the post view.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'duration': 2000}

Let me click the back button or navigate back.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {\'boxId\': \'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c\', \'keys\': [\'alt\', \'arrowLeft\']}\n[result] Keys pressed successfully\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {\'boxId\': \'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c\'}\n[result] {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood! I\'m back on the profile page. Now I can see the Ted Lasso post. Instead of clicking on the title (which opens the external link), I need to click on the "Edit" link next to the post to edit it. Let me click on the "Edit" link for the Ted Lasso post.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c\', \'target\': \'Edit link next to the Ted Lasso Season 3 Premiere post\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nIt seems the page hasn\'t changed. The edit link might not have been clicked properly. Let me scroll to make sure I can see the Ted Lasso post clearly and then try clicking the Edit link again more precisely.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c\', \'direction\': \'up\', \'distance\': \'short\'}\n[result] Scrolled up by short distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood, I scrolled up a bit. Now let me scroll down slightly to get the Ted Lasso post in view again.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c\', \'direction\': \'down\', \'distance\': \'short\'}\n[result] Scrolled down by short distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect!
