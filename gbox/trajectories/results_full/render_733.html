Good! I can see there are 2 tabs open. I'm currently on the "New Tab" page (CDP URL), and there's a Postmill tab. I need to switch to the Postmill tab (id: 2) which appears to be a Reddit-like forum. Let me switch to that tab.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__switch_tab: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'tabId': '2'}
[result] Switched to tab 2 successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I'm now on the Postmill forum page. I can see I'm logged in as "MarvelsGrantMan136" (shown in the top right). Now I need to find the post about "Star Trek Starfleet Academy series". I can see several posts on the page but I don't see one about Star Trek yet. Let me scroll down to look for it, or I could search for it using the search bar.

Let me use the search bar to find the Star Trek post more efficiently.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': 'search bar in the red header navigation'}

Good! The search bar is now active. Let me type "Star Trek Starfleet Academy" to search for the post.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'content': 'Star Trek Starfleet Academy', 'pressEnterAfterType': True}
[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the search has been executed (the URL shows the search query), but the page still shows the same posts as before. It seems like the search might not have returned specific results, or the page hasn't updated yet. Let me wait a moment and then take another screenshot to see if the search results appear.

Perfect! The search results are now showing. I can see 2 results for "Star Trek Starfleet Academy":

1. **"StarTrek: StarfleetAcademy Series, From Alex Kurtzman and Nancy Drew Creator, Ordered at Paramount+"** - This is a post submitted by MarvelsGrantMan136 (that's me!) 3 years ago in television. This appears to be the post I need to edit.

2. A comment mentioning "Star Trek Starfleet Academy" in another thread.

Let me click on the first result to open my post so I can edit it.

[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the URL has changed to "tvline.com/news/star-trek-starfleet-academy-series-order-paramount-plus-1234953497/" but the page is still showing the search results. This appears to be an external link. Let me wait for the page to load.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I see! The click took me to the actual TVLine article that was linked in the post, not to the Postmill post itself. I need to go back to the Postmill forum to find the actual post where I can edit it. Let me go back.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'keys': ['alt', 'arrowLeft']}

The back button didn't work. Let me check the tabs to see if I can switch back to the Postmill tab.

I can see that the Postmill tab has been replaced with the TVLine article. The original Postmill tab (id: 2) now shows the TVLine article. Let me click on the browser's back button to go back to the Postmill search results, or I can navigate directly back to Postmill.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': 'back arrow button in the browser navigation bar'}

The back button didn't navigate back. Let me navigate directly to the Postmill site by typing the URL in the address bar.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': 'address bar showing tvline.com URL'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I'm back on the Postmill search results page. The address bar shows the Postmill search URL. Now I can see the post about Star Trek: Starfleet Academy. I notice there's an "Edit" link next to the post. Instead of clicking on the title (which takes me to the external link), I should click on the "Edit" link to edit my post. Let me click on the "Edit" link for the first result.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': 'Edit link next to the StarTrek: StarfleetAcademy Series post'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I can see the URL has changed to include "/edit" (ec2-3-149-78-74.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/television/135201/-/edit), and the tab title shows "Editing submission Star Tre...". However, the page still shows the search results. Let me wait for the edit page to load.

Excellent! The edit page has loaded. I can now see the editing form for my Star Trek: Starfleet Academy post. I can see:

- **URL field**: Contains the TVLine link
- **Title field**: "Star Trek: Starfleet Academy Series, From Alex Kurtzman and Nancy Drew Creator, Ordered at Paramount+"
- **Body field**: This appears to be empty (blank text area)

I need to add the line "Every watch makes me feel like a kid again" to the Body field. Let me click on the Body text area and add this text.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': 'Body text area field'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! The Body text area is now focused (I can see it has a red border indicating it's active). Now I'll type the required text: "Every watch makes me feel like a kid again"
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'content': 'Every watch makes me feel like a kid again', 'pressEnterAfterType': False}
[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I have successfully added the text "Every watch makes me feel like a kid again" to the Body field. I can see it's now displayed in the text area. Now I need to save the changes by clicking the "Edit submission" button.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': 'Edit submission button'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Great! I can see that a preview has appeared at the bottom of the page showing "Every watch makes me feel like a kid again". The page is still on the edit form, which means I need to click the "Edit submission" button again to finalize and save the changes. Let me click it again.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': 'Edit submission button'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! The edit has been successfully saved! I can see:

1. **A green success message at the bottom**: "The submission was edited."
2. **The post is now displayed** with the title "Star Trek: Starfleet Academy Series, From Alex Kurtzman and Nancy Drew Creator, Ordered at Paramount+"
3. **Most importantly, the body text is now visible**: "Every watch makes me feel like a kid again"

The task has been completed successfully. The post on Star Trek Starfleet Academy series now includes the line "Every watch makes me feel like a kid again" in the body.
