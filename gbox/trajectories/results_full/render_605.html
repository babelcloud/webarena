Good! I can see there's a Postmill tab open (which is a Reddit-like test website). I can see the current page shows various submissions and on the right side there's a "Subscribed forums" section that includes "consoles" - this looks perfect for gaming console topics!

Let me click on the "consoles" forum to navigate to it.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'consoles link in the Subscribed forums section on the right side'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I see the URL has changed to include "/f/consoles" in the address bar, and the tab title now shows "consoles". However, the content still appears to be showing the same posts from before. Let me wait a moment for the page to fully load and then take another screenshot.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'duration': 1000}

[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I'm now on the /f/consoles subreddit which is focused on gaming consoles. I can see posts like "My PlayStation. Owned since new!", "My Mt Dew xbox", "What was your first console?", etc. This is the right forum for posting my question about console recommendations.

Now I need to submit a new post. I can see there's a "+ Submit" button in the top navigation bar. Let me click on it.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': '+ Submit button in the red navigation bar at the top'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the URL has changed to "submit/consoles" and the tab title shows "Create submission". However, the page content still shows the same forum listing. Let me wait for the submission form to load.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'duration': 1500}

Excellent! The submission form has loaded. I can see:
- A "Create submission" heading
- URL and Image tabs (URL is currently selected)
- A URL field (optional)
- A Title field (required, marked with *)
- A Body field (optional)
- Forum is already set to "consoles"
- A "Create submission" button

Since this is a text question, I'll enter the title as the question text. Let me click on the Title field and enter the question.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Title text input field below the Title * label'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! The Title field is now focused (I can see the red border around it). Now I'll type the question exactly as specified in the task.

Perfect! I can see the question "what is the recommended console to buy these days" has been entered in the Title field. The forum is already set to "consoles" which is correct. Now I need to click the "Create submission" button to post the question.

I can see the URL has changed to include the post slug "/f/consoles/6/what-is-the-recommended-console-to-buy-these-days" and the tab title shows "what is the recommended", which indicates the submission is being processed. However, the page still shows the submission form. Let me wait a moment for the page to fully load and redirect to the post.
