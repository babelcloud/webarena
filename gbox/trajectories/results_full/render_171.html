Good! I can see a GitLab dashboard showing projects. I can see the "Yours" tab is selected showing 14 projects. I need to find repositories where I made contributions and they got less than 5 stars. Let me look at the star counts visible on this page:

From what I can see:
- a11y-syntax-highlighting: 1 star (Owner)
- a11y-webring.club: 2 stars (Owner)
- a11yproject.com: 21 stars (Maintainer)
- accessible-html-content-patterns: 1 star (Owner)
- cloud-to-butt: 0 stars (Owner)
- design: 21 stars (Developer)
- dotfiles: 0 stars (Owner)
- empathy-prompts: 6 stars (Owner) - this has MORE than 5 stars
- ericwbailey.website: 2 stars (Owner)
- gimmiethat.space: 0 stars (Owner)

I need to scroll down to see more repositories and also check which ones I made contributions to (not just own). Let me scroll down to see more projects.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good, I can see more repositories now:
- empathy-prompts: 6 stars (Owner) - MORE than 5, exclude
- millennials-to-snake-people: 6 stars (Owner) - MORE than 5, exclude
- remove-board-movement-events-from-the-github-issue-timeline: 0 stars (Owner)
- solarized-prism-theme: 0 stars (Owner)
- timeit: 0 stars (Owner)

Let me continue scrolling to see if there are more repositories.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I see the page hasn't scrolled further - it seems I've reached the end of the list. Let me scroll back to the top to get a complete view of all repositories and identify which ones have contributions from me with less than 5 stars.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'keys': ['home']}
[result] Keys pressed successfully
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c'}
[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good, I'm back at the top. Now I need to understand the task better. The question asks for repositories where "I made contributions" - this is important because on GitLab, there's a difference between:
1. Repositories I own (marked as "Owner")
2. Repositories where I'm a maintainer or developer
3. Repositories where I contributed to (may not own)

Looking at the visible data, I see these roles:
- **Owner**: Most repos show this
- **Maintainer**: The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com (21 stars - MORE than 5)
- **Developer**: Primer / design (21 stars - MORE than 5)

However, the task says "repositories where I made contributions" - this could mean I need to look at contribution activity, not just ownership. Let me check if there's a way to see my actual contributions. Let me click on my profile or activity to see contribution history.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Byte Blaze user avatar or profile link in the top right corner'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I see a dropdown menu. Let me click on "Byte Blaze" or the username to go to the profile page to see contribution activity.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Byte Blaze profile name link in dropdown menu'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I'm still on the same page. Let me check the URL - I see it's now `/byteblaze` which should be the profile. Let me scroll down to see if there's contribution activity on this page.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I can see the activity feed. I can see contributions to **Primer / design** (multiple comments on merge requests). This is a key finding - I contributed to Primer/design but need to check if it has less than 5 stars. From the earlier view, Primer/design had 21 stars, so it doesn't qualify (it has MORE than 5 stars).

Let me continue scrolling to see all contribution activity.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'long'}
[result] Scrolled down by long distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see more contributions to Primer / design. Let me continue scrolling to see all contribution activities.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'long'}
[result] Scrolled down by long distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The page hasn't scrolled further - it seems I've reached the end of the activity feed. Let me scroll back to the top and look at the activity more carefully. I need to check if there are different tabs or views that might show contributed repositories more clearly.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'keys': ['home']}
[result] Keys pressed successfully
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c'}
[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I'm at the profile page and I can see several important tabs:
- Overview (current)
- Activity
- Groups
- **Contributed projects** - This is what I need!
- Personal projects
- Starred projects

Let me click on "Contributed projects" to see all repositories where I made contributions.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Contributed projects tab'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! I found the "Contributed projects" section. I can see only one project listed:

**The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com** - Maintainer - 21 stars

This repository has 21 stars, which is MORE than 5 stars, so it doesn't qualify.

Let me scroll down to see if there are more contributed projects.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
It appears there is only one contributed project. But wait - I saw in the activity feed that there were contributions to "Primer / design" as well. Let me go back and check the "Yours" tab more carefully. Perhaps "contributed" means repositories where I'm not the owner but made contributions. Let me check if Primer/design appears anywhere. Let me navigate back to the Projects page.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Projects link in the top navigation'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I see a dropdown menu. Let me click on "Projects" to go to the main projects page.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Projects item in the dropdown menu'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I see another submenu. Let me click on "View all projects" to see all projects.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'View all projects button'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The page is loading. Let me wait a moment and take a screenshot to see if it loads.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'duration': 1000}
[result] Finished waiting for 1000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I'm back at the Projects page. Now I can see the "Yours" tab showing 14 projects. I notice there's also "Primer / design" with 21 stars marked as "Developer". 

Let me think about this carefully. The task asks for "repositories where I made contributions and they got less than 5 stars."

In GitLab terminology:
- **Contributed projects** = Projects where you made contributions but don't own (found only 1: The A11Y Project with 21 stars - doesn't qualify)
- **Yours** = All projects where you have any access (Owner, Maintainer, Developer, etc.)

Looking at the "Yours" tab, I can see my role for each project:
1. Projects I'm "Owner" of
2. Projects I'm "Maintainer" of (The A11Y Project - 21 stars)
3. Projects I'm "Developer" on (Primer / design - 21 stars)

Both Primer/design (Developer, 21 stars) and The A11Y Project (Maintainer, 21 stars) have MORE than 5 stars, so they don't qualify.

Now let me compile the complete list from what I saw. Let me get all repository names with their stars and roles from the "Yours" tab. Let me look at the current view and scroll through again carefully noting all projects with less than 5 stars where I have contributed (any role):

From the visible data, repositories with less than 5 stars:
- **Byte Blaze / a11y-syntax-highlighting**: 1 star, Owner
- **Byte Blaze / a11y-webring.club**: 2 stars, Owner  
- **Byte Blaze / accessible-html-content-patterns**: 1 star, Owner
- **Byte Blaze / cloud-to-butt**: 0 stars, Owner
- **Byte Blaze / dotfiles**: 0 stars, Owner
- **Byte Blaze / ericwbailey.website**: 2 stars, Owner
- **Byte Blaze / gimmiethat.space**: 0 stars, Owner

Let me scroll down to see the remaining projects.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! Now I can see more projects. Let me note down the ones with less than 5 stars:

Additional projects with less than 5 stars:
- **Byte Blaze / remove-board-movement-events-from-the-github-issue-timeline**: 0 stars, Owner
- **Byte Blaze / solarized-prism-theme**: 0 stars, Owner
- **Byte Blaze / timeit**: 0 stars, Owner

Projects that have 5 or MORE stars (excluded):
- **Byte Blaze / empathy-prompts**: 6 stars, Owner (excluded)
- **Byte Blaze / millennials-to-snake-people**: 6 stars, Owner (excluded)
- **Primer / design**: 21 stars, Developer (excluded)
- **The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com**: 21 stars, Maintainer (excluded)

Let me scroll back to the top to compile the complete list of full repository names.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'keys': ['home']}
[result] Keys pressed successfully
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c'}
[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now let me compile the complete list of repositories where I made contributions (any role including Owner, Maintainer, Developer) and they have less than 5 stars.

From what I've seen, the repositories with less than 5 stars are:

1. **Byte Blaze / a11y-syntax-highlighting** - 1 star
2. **Byte Blaze / a11y-webring.club** - 2 stars  
3. **Byte Blaze / accessible-html-content-patterns** - 1 star
4. **Byte Blaze / cloud-to-butt** - 0 stars
5. **Byte Blaze / dotfiles** - 0 stars
6. **Byte Blaze / ericwbailey.website** - 2 stars
7. **Byte Blaze / gimmiethat.space** - 0 stars
8. **Byte Blaze / remove-board-movement-events-from-the-github-issue-timeline** - 0 stars
9. **Byte Blaze / solarized-prism-theme** - 0 stars
10. **Byte Blaze / timeit** - 0 stars

Now I need to provide the full names of these repositories. Looking at the GitLab interface, the full repository names are in the format "Namespace / Repository-name". Let me list them properly:
[tool] mcp__task-completion__complete_task: {'finalAnswer': 'Byte Blaze / a11y-syntax-highlighting, Byte Blaze / a11y-webring.club, Byte Blaze / accessible-html-content-patterns, Byte Blaze / cloud-to-butt, Byte Blaze / dotfiles, Byte Blaze / ericwbailey.website, Byte Blaze / gimmiethat.space, Byte Blaze / remove-board-movement-events-from-the-github-issue-timeline, Byte Blaze / solarized-prism-theme, Byte Blaze / timeit'}
[complete] Byte Blaze / a11y-syntax-highlighting, Byte Blaze / a11y-webring.club, Byte Blaze / accessible-html-content-patterns, Byte Blaze / cloud-to-butt, Byte Blaze / dotfiles, Byte Blaze / ericwbailey.website, Byte Blaze / gimmiethat.space, Byte Blaze / remove-board-movement-events-from-the-github-issue-timeline, Byte Blaze / solarized-prism-theme, Byte Blaze / timeit

Let me click on "Byte Blaze" or the username to go to the profile page to see contribution activity.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'target\': \'Byte Blaze profile name link in dropdown menu\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI\'m still on the same page. Let me check the URL - I see it\'s now `/byteblaze` which should be the profile. Let me scroll down to see if there\'s contribution activity on this page.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'direction\': \'down\', \'distance\': \'medium\'}\n[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect! Now I can see the activity feed. I can see contributions to **Primer / design** (multiple comments on merge requests). This is a key finding - I contributed to Primer/design but need to check if it has less than 5 stars. From the earlier view, Primer/design had 21 stars, so it doesn\'t qualify (it has MORE than 5 stars).\n\nLet me continue scrolling to see all contribution activity.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'direction\': \'down\', \'distance\': \'long\'}\n[result] Scrolled down by long distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI can see more contributions to Primer / design. Let me continue scrolling to see all contribution activities.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'direction\': \'down\', \'distance\': \'long\'}\n[result] Scrolled down by long distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nThe page hasn\'t scrolled further - it seems I\'ve reached the end of the activity feed. Let me scroll back to the top and look at the activity more carefully. I need to check if there are different tabs or views that might show contributed repositories more clearly.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'keys\': [\'home\']}\n[result] Keys pressed successfully\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\'}\n[result] {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect! Now I\'m at the profile page and I can see several important tabs:\n- Overview (current)\n- Activity\n- Groups\n- **Contributed projects** - This is what I need!\n- Personal projects\n- Starred projects\n\nLet me click on "Contributed projects" to see all repositories where I made contributions.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'target\': \'Contributed projects tab\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nExcellent! I found the "Contributed projects" section. I can see only one project listed:\n\n**The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com** - Maintainer - 21 stars\n\nThis repository has 21 stars, which is MORE than 5 stars, so it doesn\'t qualify.\n\nLet me scroll down to see if there are more contributed projects.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'direction\': \'down\', \'distance\': \'medium\'}\n[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nIt appears there is only one contributed project. But wait - I saw in the activity feed that there were contributions to "Primer / design" as well. Let me go back and check the "Yours" tab more carefully. Perhaps "contributed" means repositories where I\'m not the owner but made contributions. Let me check if Primer/design appears anywhere. Let me navigate back to the Projects page.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'target\': \'Projects link in the top navigation\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI see a dropdown menu. Let me click on "Projects" to go to the main projects page.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'target\': \'Projects item in the dropdown menu\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI see another submenu. Let me click on "View all projects" to see all projects.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'target\': \'View all projects button\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nThe page is loading.

I\'m back at the Projects page. Now I can see the "Yours" tab showing 14 projects. I notice there\'s also "Primer / design" with 21 stars marked as "Developer". \n\nLet me think about this carefully. The task asks for "repositories where I made contributions and they got less than 5 stars."\n\nIn GitLab terminology:\n- **Contributed projects** = Projects where you made contributions but don\'t own (found only 1: The A11Y Project with 21 stars - doesn\'t qualify)\n- **Yours** = All projects where you have any access (Owner, Maintainer, Developer, etc.)\n\nLooking at the "Yours" tab, I can see my role for each project:\n1. Projects I\'m "Owner" of\n2. Projects I\'m "Maintainer" of (The A11Y Project - 21 stars)\n3. Projects I\'m "Developer" on (Primer / design - 21 stars)\n\nBoth Primer/design (Developer, 21 stars) and The A11Y Project (Maintainer, 21 stars) have MORE than 5 stars, so they don\'t qualify.\n\nNow let me compile the complete list from what I saw. Let me get all repository names with their stars and roles from the "Yours" tab. Let me look at the current view and scroll through again carefully noting all projects with less than 5 stars where I have contributed (any role):\n\nFrom the visible data, repositories with less than 5 stars:\n- **Byte Blaze / a11y-syntax-highlighting**: 1 star, Owner\n- **Byte Blaze / a11y-webring.club**: 2 stars, Owner  \n- **Byte Blaze / accessible-html-content-patterns**: 1 star, Owner\n- **Byte Blaze / cloud-to-butt**: 0 stars, Owner\n- **Byte Blaze / dotfiles**: 0 stars, Owner\n- **Byte Blaze / ericwbailey.website**: 2 stars, Owner\n- **Byte Blaze / gimmiethat.space**: 0 stars, Owner\n\nLet me scroll down to see the remaining projects.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'direction\': \'down\', \'distance\': \'medium\'}\n[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood! Now I can see more projects. Let me note down the ones with less than 5 stars:\n\nAdditional projects with less than 5 stars:\n- **Byte Blaze / remove-board-movement-events-from-the-github-issue-timeline**: 0 stars, Owner\n- **Byte Blaze / solarized-prism-theme**: 0 stars, Owner\n- **Byte Blaze / timeit**: 0 stars, Owner\n\nProjects that have 5 or MORE stars (excluded):\n- **Byte Blaze / empathy-prompts**: 6 stars, Owner (excluded)\n- **Byte Blaze / millennials-to-snake-people**: 6 stars, Owner (excluded)\n- **Primer / design**: 21 stars, Developer (excluded)\n- **The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com**: 21 stars, Maintainer (excluded)\n\nLet me scroll back to the top to compile the complete list of full repository names.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'keys\': [\'home\']}\n[result] Keys pressed successfully\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\'}\n[result] {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect! Now let me compile the complete list of repositories where I made contributions (any role including Owner, Maintainer, Developer) and they have less than 5 stars.\n\nFrom what I\'ve seen, the repositories with less than 5 stars are:\n\n1. **Byte Blaze / a11y-syntax-highlighting** - 1 star\n2. **Byte Blaze / a11y-webring.club** - 2 stars  \n3. **Byte Blaze / accessible-html-content-patterns** - 1 star\n4. **Byte Blaze / cloud-to-butt** - 0 stars\n5. **Byte Blaze / dotfiles** - 0 stars\n6. **Byte Blaze / ericwbailey.website** - 2 stars\n7. **Byte Blaze / gimmiethat.space** - 0 stars\n8. **Byte Blaze / remove-board-movement-events-from-the-github-issue-timeline** - 0 stars\n9. **Byte Blaze / solarized-prism-theme** - 0 stars\n10. **Byte Blaze / timeit** - 0 stars\n\nNow I need to provide the full names of these repositories. Looking at the GitLab interface, the full repository names are in the format "Namespace / Repository-name". Let me list them properly:\n[tool] mcp__task-completion__complete_task: {\'finalAnswer\': \'Byte Blaze / a11y-syntax-highlighting, Byte Blaze / a11y-webring.club, Byte Blaze / accessible-html-content-patterns, Byte Blaze / cloud-to-butt, Byte Blaze / dotfiles, Byte Blaze / ericwbailey.website, Byte Blaze / gimmiethat.space, Byte Blaze / remove-board-movement-events-from-the-github-issue-timeline, Byte Blaze / solarized-prism-theme, Byte Blaze / timeit\'}\n[complete] Byte Blaze / a11y-syntax-highlighting, Byte Blaze / a11y-webring.club, Byte Blaze / accessible-html-content-patterns, Byte Blaze / cloud-to-butt, Byte Blaze / dotfiles, Byte Blaze / ericwbailey.website, Byte Blaze / gimmiethat.space, Byte Blaze / remove-board-movement-events-from-the-github-issue-timeline, Byte Blaze / solarized-prism-theme, Byte Blaze / timeit\nTask complete!
