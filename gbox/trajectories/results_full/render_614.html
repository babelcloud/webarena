Good! I can see there are 2 tabs open:
1. Tab 1: New Tab (CDP URL - I should not switch to this)
2. Tab 2: Postmill (the Reddit-like test site)

I'm currently viewing the Postmill homepage. I can see:
- The site is Postmill (a Reddit-like platform)
- User "MarvelsGrantMan136" is logged in
- There's a "Submit" button in the top navigation
- There's a "Forums" link in the navigation

I need to navigate to the r/books forum and post a review. Let me click on "Forums" to find the r/books forum.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'Forums link in the top red navigation bar'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the page has loaded (URL changed to /forums) but the page appears mostly blank. The message says "You are not subscribed to any forum. Showing featured forums instead." but there are no featured forums displayed. Let me scroll down to see if there are any forums listed below.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! Now I can see the list of forums. I can see various forums like:
- /r/technology
- /r/pics
- /r/funny
- /r/television
- /r/mildlyinteresting
- /r/Showerthoughts
- /r/todayilearned
- /r/personalfinance
- /r/LifeProTips
- /r/Futurology

I need to find /r/books. Let me continue scrolling down to look for it.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I found /r/books! I can see:
- /r/books
- books
- 1,800 submissions

Now I need to click on the /r/books link to enter that forum so I can post my review.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': '/r/books red link text'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the URL has changed to /f/books in the address bar, and the tab title now shows "books". However, the page content still shows the forum list. Let me wait a moment for the page to fully load.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'duration': 1500}
[result] Finished waiting for 1500ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! Now I'm on the /r/books forum page. I can see:
- The page header shows "/f/books"
- There are existing submissions about books
- There's a "Submit" button in the top navigation bar

Now I need to click the "Submit" button to create a new post where I can write my review of "Gone with the Wind".
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'Submit button in the top red navigation bar with plus icon'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I'm now on the submission creation page. I can see:
- A "Create submission" form
- URL field (currently selected)
- Title field (required, marked with *)
- Body field
- Forum dropdown (already set to "books")
- "Create submission" button

I need to fill in:
1. Title: Something about "Gone with the Wind" review
2. Body: "It's a book with history"

Let me start by clicking on the Title field and entering the title.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'Title text input field with asterisk'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! The Title field is now focused (I can see it has a red border). Now I'll type the title for my review of "Gone with the Wind".
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'content': 'Gone with the wind', 'pressEnterAfterType': False}
[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! The title "Gone with the wind" has been entered in the Title field. Now I need to click on the Body field and enter my comment "It's a book with history".
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'Body text area field below the Title field'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! The Body field is now focused (I can see the red border around it). Now I'll type the comment "It's a book with history".
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'content': "It's a book with history", 'pressEnterAfterType': False}
[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I have successfully filled in all the required fields:
- Title: "Gone with the wind"
- Body: "It's a book with history"
- Forum: "books" (already selected)

Now I need to click the "Create submission" button to post this review to r/books.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'Create submission red button'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Interesting! I can see that:
1. The URL has changed to include the post slug: `/f/books/10/gone-with-the-wind`
2. A "Preview" section has appeared showing "it's a book with history"
3. The form is still visible with the "Create submission" button

It looks like the page is showing a preview of the post. I notice the URL has changed to include "/10/gone-with-the-wind", which suggests the post might have been created. Let me scroll down to see if there's any confirmation message or if I need to click the button again.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'short'}
[result] Scrolled down by short distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! The post has been successfully created! I can now see:

1. The post is live on the page with the title "Gone with the wind"
2. It shows "Submitted by MarvelsGrantMan136 1 second ago in books"
3. The body text "it's a book with history" is visible
4. The post has 1 point (+1, -0)
5. The URL is: http://ec2-3-149-78-74.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/books/10/gone-with-the-wind
6. There's a "Comments" section below
7. The tab title shows "Gone with the wind"

The task has been completed successfully! I've posted a review of "Gone with the Wind" in r/books with the comment "It's a book with history". Now I need to call the complete_task function to finalize this.
