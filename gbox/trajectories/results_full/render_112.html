Good! I can see I'm in the Magento Admin Dashboard. To find customers who have expressed dissatisfaction with "Circe fleece", I need to look for product reviews or customer feedback. Let me navigate to the appropriate section. I'll check the Marketing or Customers section to find reviews.

Let me click on the Marketing section first to see if there are product reviews there.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'MARKETING menu item in left sidebar'}

[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'All Reviews link in the Marketing menu'}

I see the page is loading. Let me wait a moment for it to fully load and then take a screenshot to see the reviews page.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'duration': 2000}

Excellent! I can see the Reviews page with 351 records. I can already see some reviews about "Circe Hooded Ice Fleece" in the table. Let me look for reviews that show dissatisfaction with this product. I can see:

1. Review ID 353 - Hannah Lim: "I was really disappointed with the Circe Hooded..."
2. Review ID 352 - customer: "I recently purchased the Circe Hooded Ice Fleec..."

These appear to be reviews about the Circe fleece. Let me use the search/filter functionality to specifically find all reviews related to "Circe fleece" to ensure I capture all dissatisfied customers. Let me type in the Product search field.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'Product column filter text input field'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I see a dropdown appeared. Let me click on the Product text input field to type in my search term. Let me click elsewhere first to close this dropdown and then try the Product filter field.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'Product text input field in the filter row'}

Good, now I have the Product filter field selected (I can see it's highlighted in blue). Let me type "Circe" to filter for Circe fleece products.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'content': 'Circe'}
[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I've typed "Circe" in the Product filter field. Now I need to click the "Search" button to apply the filter.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'Search button'}

I notice the URL has changed indicating a filter was applied, but the results still show 351 records and include products other than Circe fleece (I can see Olivia jackets and Antonia Racer Tanks). Let me scroll down to see if there are more Circe fleece reviews, or let me try a more specific filter. Let me check the Product column filter input field to see what was entered.

I can see the filter didn't work as expected - it still shows 351 records with various products. Let me click on "Reset Filter" first and try a different approach. I'll look at the visible reviews that mention "Circe Hooded Ice Fleece" directly. I can see two reviews already visible:

1. Review ID 353 - Hannah Lim: "I was really disappointed with the Circe Hooded..." - Product: Circe Hooded Ice Fleece
2. Review ID 352 - customer: "I recently purchased the Circe Hooded Ice Fleec..." - Product: Circe Hooded Ice Fleece

But I need to see the complete review text and check if there are more. Let me click on the first review to see the full details.

Perfect! I can now see the full review details for review ID 353:

**Review 1:**
- **Product:** Circe Hooded Ice Fleece
- **Nickname:** Hannah Lim
- **Summary:** Bad!
- **Rating:** 1 star (very dissatisfied)
- **Review:** "I was really disappointed with the Circe Hooded Ice Fleece. The material is not very high quality and started pilling after just one wash. The fit was also really strange - the sleeves were too short and the body was too baggy, making me look frumpy. I was hoping this would be a cozy layer for winter walks, but it doesn't keep me very warm either. Finally, the hood is way too big and just falls down over my face. I wouldn't recommend this product - there are much better options out there for the price."

This is clearly a dissatisfied customer. Now let me go back and check the other review (ID 352) to see if it's also expressing dissatisfaction. Let me click "Next" to see the next review.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'Next button'}

It seems the page didn't navigate to the next review. Let me wait a moment and try again, or I'll go back to the reviews list to check review ID 352.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'duration': 1000}

Good! Now I can see review ID 352. This review shows:

**Review 2:**
- **Product:** Circe Hooded Ice Fleece
- **Nickname:** customer
- **Summary:** Good but not perfect
- **Rating:** 4 stars (satisfied, not dissatisfied)
- **Review:** "I recently purchased the Circe Hooded Ice Fleece and overall, I'm quite happy with it. The fleece material is incredibly soft and cozy, and I love the addition of the hood for extra warmth. The fit is true to size and the sleeves are long enough, which is often a problem for me. The only reason I'm not giving it a full 5 stars is because I was hoping the color would be a bit more vibrant - it's a bit muted compared to what I was expecting. But overall, I would definitely recommend the Circe Hooded Ice Fleece for anyone in need of a warm and comfortable layer for outdoor activities."

This customer is actually **satisfied** with the product (4 stars), not dissatisfied. Let me go back to the reviews list to check if there are any other reviews about the Circe fleece. Let me click "Back" to return to the list.

The back button didn't work. Let me click on the "Reviews / Customer Reviews" link in the breadcrumb at the top or use the MARKETING menu to navigate back to the reviews list.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'MARKETING menu item in left sidebar'}

[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I'm back on the Reviews page. I can see the two Circe Hooded Ice Fleece reviews (ID 353 and 352) on the first page. Now I need to search through all the reviews to make sure I find ALL customers who expressed dissatisfaction with the Circe fleece. Let me scroll down to see if there are more Circe fleece reviews on this page, or I should use the search/filter functionality more effectively.

Looking at the current visible data, I only see 2 reviews for "Circe Hooded Ice Fleece":
1. Review ID 353 - Hannah Lim - "Bad!" - 1 star (DISSATISFIED)
2. Review ID 352 - customer - "Good but not perfect" - 4 stars (SATISFIED)

Let me scroll down to check if there are more reviews on this page.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see more reviews now, but none of them are for "Circe Hooded Ice Fleece" - they're for other products like Chloe Compete Tank, Breathe-Easy Tank, Bella Tank, Zoe Tank, and Erika Running Short. 

Since there are 351 total records, I need to use the filter more effectively. Let me scroll back up and properly filter by the product name "Circe" using the Product filter field. This time I'll make sure the filter is applied correctly.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled up by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I can see the filter row now. I notice there are currently only 2 reviews for "Circe Hooded Ice Fleece" visible on the current page (IDs 353 and 352). Let me try a different approach - let me use the Title or Review column filter to search for reviews that mention dissatisfaction. But first, let me try filtering by the Product column with "Circe Hooded Ice Fleece" to see all reviews for this specific product.

Let me click on the Product filter input field.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'Product column text input field in the filter row'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! The Product filter field is now active (highlighted in blue). Let me type "Circe Hooded Ice Fleece" to filter for this specific product.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'content': 'Circe Hooded Ice Fleece'}
[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I can see "Circe Hooded Ice Fleece" is now typed in the Product filter field. Now let me click the "Search" button to apply this filter.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'Search button'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The page is loading. Let me wait for the filtered results to appear.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! The filter worked perfectly! Now I can see **"2 records found"** for "Circe Hooded Ice Fleece". The two reviews are:

1. **Review ID 353** - Hannah Lim - "Bad!" - "I was really disappointed with the Circe Hooded..."
2. **Review ID 352** - customer - "Good but not perfect" - "I recently purchased the Circe Hooded Ice Fleec..."

From my earlier detailed review of both, I know that:
- Review ID 353 (Hannah Lim) gave **1 star** and expressed **dissatisfaction**
- Review ID 352 (customer) gave **4 stars** and was **satisfied** (just wished the color was more vibrant)

So there is only **ONE customer who expressed dissatisfaction** with the Circe fleece: **Hannah Lim**.

Let me verify this by clicking on review ID 353 once more to confirm the customer name.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'Edit link for review ID 353'}

Perfect! I can now confirm the details of the dissatisfied customer:

**Customer who expressed dissatisfaction with Circe fleece:**
- **Nickname:** Hannah Lim
- **Product:** Circe Hooded Ice Fleece
- **Rating:** 1 star (out of 5)
- **Summary:** Bad!

The material is not very high quality and started pilling after just one wash. The fit was also really strange - the sleeves were too short and the body was too baggy, making me look frumpy. I was hoping this would be a cozy layer for winter walks, but it doesn\'t keep me very warm either. Finally, the hood is way too big and just falls down over my face. I wouldn\'t recommend this product - there are much better options out there for the price."\n\nThis is clearly a dissatisfied customer.

This review shows:\n\n**Review 2:**\n- **Product:** Circe Hooded Ice Fleece\n- **Nickname:** customer\n- **Summary:** Good but not perfect\n- **Rating:** 4 stars (satisfied, not dissatisfied)\n- **Review:** "I recently purchased the Circe Hooded Ice Fleece and overall, I\'m quite happy with it. The fleece material is incredibly soft and cozy, and I love the addition of the hood for extra warmth. The fit is true to size and the sleeves are long enough, which is often a problem for me. The only reason I\'m not giving it a full 5 stars is because I was hoping the color would be a bit more vibrant - it\'s a bit muted compared to what I was expecting. But overall, I would definitely recommend the Circe Hooded Ice Fleece for anyone in need of a warm and comfortable layer for outdoor activities."\n\nThis customer is actually **satisfied** with the product (4 stars), not dissatisfied.

I\'m back on the Reviews page. I can see the two Circe Hooded Ice Fleece reviews (ID 353 and 352) on the first page. Now I need to search through all the reviews to make sure I find ALL customers who expressed dissatisfaction with the Circe fleece.

Let me scroll back up and properly filter by the product name "Circe" using the Product filter field.
