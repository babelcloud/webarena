Good! I can see I'm in the Magento Admin Dashboard. To delete reviews from a scammer named Carlo, I need to access the reviews section. In Magento, reviews are typically found under Marketing or Content sections. Let me look for the Marketing menu on the left sidebar.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'MARKETING menu item in the left sidebar'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! The Marketing menu has opened and I can see "All Reviews" under the "User Content" section. Let me click on "All Reviews" to access the reviews page.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'All Reviews link under User Content section'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I see the page is loading. Let me wait a moment for it to fully load and then take a screenshot to see the reviews page.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! I can now see the Reviews page with 347 records. I can see a table with columns including ID, Created, Status, Title, Nickname, Review, Visibility, Type, Product, SKU, and Action. I need to search for reviews from "Carlo" using the Nickname filter. Let me click on the Nickname filter field and type "Carlo".
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'text input field in the Nickname column filter row'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good, the Nickname filter field is now active (highlighted in blue). Let me type "Carlo" to search for reviews from this user.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'content': 'Carlo'}
[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I've typed "Carlo" in the Nickname filter. Now I need to click the "Search" button to apply the filter and find all reviews from Carlo.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'Search button'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The page is loading. Let me wait for the search results to load completely.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! The search results show "2 records found" with reviews from Carlo (the scammer). I can see two reviews:

1. Review ID 109 - "I wear these to my gym daily. I go hard" (Title: "I wear these to my gym daily. I go hard") - Product: Torque Power Short
2. Review ID 93 - "Ripped the FIRST TIME I wore it" (Title: "Ripped the FIRST TIME I wore it") - Product: Logan HeatTec® Tee

Now I need to select both reviews and delete them. Let me first click the checkbox in the header row to select all reviews on this page.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'checkbox in the header row of the table, leftmost column'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I see that only one review (ID 109) is currently selected. The text shows "2 records found ( 1 selected )". Let me click the checkbox in the header row again to select all reviews.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'checkbox in the header row, next to ID column'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I see the selections were deselected. Let me manually select both checkboxes. First, let me click on the checkbox for review ID 109.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'checkbox in the row with ID 109'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! Review ID 109 is now selected (shown as "1 selected"). Now let me click on the checkbox for review ID 93 to select the second review as well.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'checkbox in the row with ID 93'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Both reviews are now selected. I can see "2 records found ( 2 selected )" and both checkboxes are checked. Now I need to use the "Actions" dropdown to delete these reviews. Let me click on the Actions dropdown.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'Actions dropdown button'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! The Actions dropdown menu has opened. I can see several options:
- Mass Actions
- Select All
- Unselect All
- Select Visible
- Unselect Visible

I don't see a "Delete" option in this dropdown. Let me scroll down or look for another way to access the delete action. Let me click on "Mass Actions" to see if it expands with more options.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'Mass Actions option in the dropdown menu'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The dropdown is still showing the same options. Let me close this dropdown and look for another way to delete the reviews. In Magento, there's usually a dropdown next to "Actions" that lets you select the action type. Let me click elsewhere to close this dropdown first, then look for the action selector.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'keys': ['escape']}
[result] Keys pressed successfully

[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good, the dropdown is closed. I notice there's a dropdown arrow next to "Actions". Looking at the interface more carefully, I should look for another dropdown that specifies the type of action. Let me click on the dropdown that says "Actions" with the arrow, as this might contain the action types like "Delete".
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'dropdown arrow button next to Actions text'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I can see the Actions dropdown menu with the options:
- Actions (currently selected, highlighted in blue)
- Delete
- Update Status

I need to click on "Delete" to select the delete action.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'Delete option in the dropdown menu'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! The "Delete" action has been selected (I can see the dropdown now shows "Delete" instead of "Actions"), and a "Submit" button has appeared next to it. The text still shows "2 records found ( 2 selected )", confirming both Carlo's reviews are selected. Now I need to click the "Submit" button to execute the delete action.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'Submit button'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! A confirmation dialog has appeared asking "Are you sure?" with two buttons: "Cancel" and "OK". I need to click "OK" to confirm the deletion of Carlo's reviews.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'OK button in the confirmation dialog'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The page is loading. Let me wait for it to complete and then take a screenshot to verify if the reviews have been deleted.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'duration': 3000}
[result] Finished waiting for 3000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! The reviews have been successfully deleted. I can see:

1. A success message at the top: "A total of 2 record(s) have been deleted." (in a yellow banner)
2. The page now shows "0 records found" (previously showed 2 records)
3. The message "We couldn't find any records." is displayed in the table
4. The Nickname filter still shows "Carlo" from my search

This confirms that all reviews from the scammer Carlo have been successfully deleted from the system. The task is complete!
[tool] mcp__task-completion__complete_task: {'finalAnswer': 'Successfully deleted all 2 reviews from the scammer Carlo. The system confirmed "A total of 2 record(s) have been deleted."'}
[complete] Successfully deleted all 2 reviews from the scammer Carlo. The system confirmed \"A total of 2 record(s) have been deleted.\
Task completed! I have successfully deleted all reviews from the scammer Carlo. The system deleted 2 reviews total:
1. Review ID 109 - "I wear these to my gym daily. I go hard" on Torque Power Short
2. Review ID 93 - "Ripped the FIRST TIME I wore it" on Logan HeatTec® Tee

Let me click on the dropdown that says "Actions" with the arrow, as this might contain the action types like "Delete".\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c\', \'target\': \'dropdown arrow button next to Actions text\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect!

The "Delete" action has been selected (I can see the dropdown now shows "Delete" instead of "Actions"), and a "Submit" button has appeared next to it. The text still shows "2 records found ( 2 selected )", confirming both Carlo\'s reviews are selected. Now I need to click the "Submit" button to execute the delete action.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c\', \'target\': \'Submit button\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect!
