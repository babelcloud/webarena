I can see I'm on a Magento Admin Dashboard. The task asks about "brands that appear most frequently among the top search terms". I can see there's a "Last Search Terms" section at the bottom of the page showing "tanks" with 23 results and 1 use. I need to scroll down to see more search terms to analyze which brands appear most frequently.

Let me scroll down to see the complete list of search terms.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I can see both "Last Search Terms" and "Top Search Terms" sections. The task specifically asks about "top search terms", so I should focus on the "Top Search Terms" section. I can see:

1. hollister - 1 result, 19 uses
2. Joust Bag - 10 results, 4 uses
3. Antonia Racer Tank - 23 results, 2 uses
4. tanks - 23 results, 1 use
5. WP10 - 1 result, 1 use

However, I need to see if there are more top search terms. Let me check if there's a way to view all top search terms or if I need to navigate to a more detailed report. The task asks about "brands" specifically, so I need to identify which of these search terms are brands.

From what I can see:
- "hollister" appears to be a brand name (Hollister is a clothing brand)
- "nike" appears in the Last Search Terms (also a brand)
- "Joust Bag", "Antonia Racer Tank", "tanks", and "WP10" seem to be product names rather than brands

Let me check if there's a more detailed view of search terms. I should look for a way to access more comprehensive search term data. Let me click on the "Top Search Terms" section to see if it expands or leads to a detailed report.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Top Search Terms heading'}

The click didn't navigate anywhere. Let me look for a way to access more detailed search term data. I should check if there's a Reports section in the Magento admin that might have more comprehensive search term information. Let me use the Magento admin subagent to find out where to access detailed search term reports.
[tool] Task: {'description': 'Find search terms report location', 'prompt': 'Where can I find a detailed report of search terms in Magento Admin? I need to see all the top search terms to identify which brands appear most frequently.', 'subagent_type': 'magento-admin-guide', 'model': 'haiku'}
Where can I find a detailed report of search terms in Magento Admin? I need to see all the top search terms to identify which brands appear most frequently.
[result] I'll help you locate the search terms report in the Magento Admin interface.

**Location**: Marketing > SEO & Search > Search Terms

**Description**: This report provides a comprehensive list of searc
Perfect! The search terms report is located at Marketing > SEO & Search > Search Terms. Let me navigate there to see a comprehensive list of all search terms.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'MARKETING menu item in the left sidebar'}

Great! The Marketing menu is now open. I can see "Search Terms" under the "SEO & Search" section. Let me click on it.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Search Terms link under SEO & Search section'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the page is loading (there's a loading spinner icon in the tab). Let me wait for the page to fully load.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I can see the Search Terms report. It shows "7 records found" and I can see the following search terms with their uses:

1. Joust Bag - 10 results, 4 uses
2. MT02-M-Gray - 115 results, 1 use
3. WP10 - 1 result, 1 use
4. hollister - 1 result, 19 uses
5. Antonia Racer Tank - 23 results, 2 uses
6. nike - 0 results, 3 uses
7. tanks - 23 results, 1 use

Now I need to identify which of these are brands. The "Uses" column indicates how many times customers searched for that term. Let me sort by "Uses" to see the top search terms more clearly. But first, let me check if there are more records by looking at the pagination or changing the per page setting.

I can see it says "7 records found" and shows "page 1 of 1", so these are all the search terms. Now I need to identify which are brands:

- **hollister** - 19 uses (this is clearly a brand name - Hollister Co. is a clothing brand)
- **nike** - 3 uses (this is clearly a brand name - Nike is a major sportswear brand)
- Joust Bag - 4 uses (product name, not a brand)
- Antonia Racer Tank - 2 uses (product name, not a brand)
- MT02-M-Gray - 1 use (appears to be a product SKU/code, not a brand)
- WP10 - 1 use (appears to be a product code, not a brand)
- tanks - 1 use (generic product category, not a brand)

To be thorough and ensure I'm looking at the "top search terms" correctly, let me sort by the "Uses" column to see them ranked by frequency. Let me click on the "Uses" column header to sort.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Uses column header in the search terms table'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The page is loading after clicking the sort. Let me wait for it to load completely.

[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! The table is now sorted. I can see it's sorted by "Uses" in ascending order (lowest to highest). Let me click on the "Uses" column header again to sort it in descending order (highest to lowest) to see the top search terms first.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Uses column header in the search terms table'}

[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now the search terms are sorted by "Uses" in descending order (highest to lowest). I can see all 7 search terms ranked by frequency:

**Top Search Terms (by Uses):**
1. **hollister** - 19 uses (BRAND)
2. Joust Bag - 4 uses (product)
3. **nike** - 3 uses (BRAND)
4. Antonia Racer Tank - 2 uses (product)
5. MT02-M-Gray - 1 use (product code)
6. WP10 - 1 use (product code)
7. tanks - 1 use (category)

Among the top search terms, the brands that appear are:
1. **Hollister** - 19 uses (most frequent)
2. **Nike** - 3 uses

Since there are only 2 brands total in the search terms, and the question asks "What brands appear most frequently among the top search terms?", I need to identify which brand appears most frequently. 

**Hollister** appears most frequently with 19 uses, followed by Nike with 3 uses.

However, the question asks for "brands" (plural) that appear "most frequently", which suggests they want to know which brands are the top ones. Given the data:
- Hollister is clearly the #1 brand (19 uses)
- Nike is the #2 brand (3 uses)

But since Hollister has significantly more uses than Nike (19 vs 3), and it's the only brand with substantial search volume, the answer should be "Hollister" as it appears most frequently.

Let me complete the task with this answer.
[tool] mcp__task-completion__complete_task: {'finalAnswer': 'Hollister'}
[complete] Hollister
The task is complete. Based on my analysis of the Search Terms report in the Magento Admin, **Hollister** is the brand that appears most frequently among the top search terms with 19 uses, significantly more than any other brand (Nike had only 3 uses).</pre></div><div class='action_object' style='background-color:grey'><pre>{'action_type': <ActionTypes.STOP: 17>, 'coords': array([0., 0.], dtype=float32), 'element_role': 0, 'element_name': '', 'text': [], 'page_number': 0, 'url': '', 'nth': 0, 'pw_code': '', 'element_id': '', 'key_comb': '', 'direction': '', 'answer': 'Hollister', 'raw_prediction': 'I\'ll start by taking a screenshot to see the current state of the browser and understand what website I\'m working with.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__list_tabs: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\'}\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\'}\n[result] {\n  "data": [\n    {\n      "id": "1",\n      "title": "New Tab",\n      "url": "chrome://new-tab-page/",\n      "favicon": "chrome://new-tab-page/favicon.ico",\n      "active": true,\n      "loading": false\n[result] {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI can see I\'m on a Magento Admin Dashboard.
