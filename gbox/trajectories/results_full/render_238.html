Let me start by checking what tabs are currently open and taking a screenshot to see the current state.

Good! I can see the One Stop Market website is already open. I can see the homepage with various product categories in the navigation menu. I need to find the "Video Games" section to access PS4 accessories. I can see "Video Games" in the navigation menu at the top. Let me click on it.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Video Games menu item in the navigation bar'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! A dropdown menu has appeared with video game categories. I can see:
- Xbox One
- PC
- Legacy Systems
- PlayStation 4
- Nintendo Switch

I need to click on "PlayStation 4" to access PS4 products.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'PlayStation 4 option in the dropdown menu'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I'm now on the Video Games page. I can see the shopping options on the left sidebar with categories including:
- Xbox One (158)
- PC (181)
- Legacy Systems (293)
- PlayStation 4 (233)
- Nintendo Switch (51)

I need to click on "PlayStation 4" to filter for PS4 products, and then I'll need to find the PS4 accessories subcategory.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'PlayStation 4 link in the Shopping Options Category section on the left sidebar'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I've filtered to PlayStation 4 products. Now I can see:
- "Now Shopping by" shows "Category: PlayStation 4"
- The page shows "Items 1-12 of 233"
- In the Shopping Options section, I can see "Category: Accessories (228)"

I need to click on "Accessories" to filter specifically for PS4 accessories.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Accessories link showing 228 items in the Shopping Options Category section'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I notice the page hasn't changed - it still shows the same products. Let me scroll down to see if the accessories filter has been applied, or I may need to wait for the page to load.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! The page has updated. I can see:
- "Now Shopping by" shows "Category: Accessories"
- "Items 1-12 of 228" - there are 228 PS4 accessories
- The URL has changed to include "cat=236"

Now I need to sort the products by price to find the most expensive one. I can see there's a "Sort By" dropdown currently set to "Position". Let me change it to sort by price (highest to lowest). I'll click on the Sort By dropdown.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Sort By dropdown menu showing Position'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! The dropdown menu has opened showing three options:
- Position
- Product Name
- Price

I'll click on "Price" to sort by price.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Price option in the Sort By dropdown menu'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! The page is now sorted by "Price" as shown in the dropdown. However, I notice the products are still showing in what appears to be the same order. The default sorting by price is usually lowest to highest. I need to check if there's a way to reverse the sort order to show highest price first. Let me look for a sort direction button. I can see there's an up arrow next to the sort dropdown - let me click on it to reverse the sort order.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'up arrow button next to the Price dropdown for reversing sort order'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! The page has now sorted by price, and I can see the products are showing from lowest to highest price:
- Dechoga PS4 Charging Board - $1.59
- Replacement Screwdriver Tear Down Repair Tool - $1.82
- Touch Pad Connect Cable - $1.99
- Replacement Full Button - $3.58

But I need the MOST expensive product, so I need to click the arrow again to reverse the sort order to show highest price first.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'up arrow button next to the Price dropdown'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now the products are sorted from highest to lowest price. I can see the most expensive products:

1. **ASTRO Gaming A50 Wireless Headset + Base Station Gen 4 - Compatible With PS5, PS4, PC, Mac Black/Silver** - **$253.99**
2. PC Steering Wheel, PXN V9 Universal Usb Car Sim - $199.99
3. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (Spiderman) Sony Playstation 4 PS4 Game - $135.00
4. Blue Stripe Flag Custom Wireless UN-MODDED PRO Controller - $129.95

The most expensive product in the PS4 accessories category is the **ASTRO Gaming A50 Wireless Headset + Base Station Gen 4** priced at **$253.99**.

Let me verify this is indeed the most expensive by checking if there are any other products with higher prices. I can see the arrow is now pointing down, indicating descending order (highest to lowest), which is correct. Let me take a closer look at the first product to get the exact details.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86'}
[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I notice the page has changed back to showing the lowest priced items again (the charging board at $1.59 is back). It seems the sort order may have toggled back. Let me scroll up to see if the most expensive items are at the top of the page, or I may need to adjust the sort again.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled up by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I'm still seeing the low-priced items. The sort appears to be showing lowest to highest. Let me click on the sort direction arrow to reverse it to show the highest priced items first.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'arrow button next to the Price dropdown in the Sort By section'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The page is loading - I can see the URL now includes "&product_list_dir=desc" which means it's sorting in descending order (highest to lowest). Let me wait for the page to fully load.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'duration': 3000}
[result] Finished waiting for 3000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! The page has loaded with products sorted from highest to lowest price. I can now clearly see the most expensive PS4 accessories:

1. **ASTRO Gaming A50 Wireless Headset + Base Station Gen 4 - Compatible With PS5, PS4, PC, Mac Black/Silver** - **$253.99**
