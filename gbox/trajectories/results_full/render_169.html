Good! I can see I'm on a GitLab dashboard showing projects. I can see the "Yours" tab is selected (showing 19 projects). I need to find repositories where I made contributions that got the most stars. 

Looking at the current view, I can see several projects with star counts:
- a11y-syntax-highlighting: 1 star
- a11y-webring.club: 2 stars
- The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com: 21 stars
- accessible-html-content-patterns: 1 star
- And several with 0 stars

I also see at the bottom there's a "Primer / design" project with 21 stars. However, I need to check if these are repositories where I made contributions (as opposed to my own repositories). Let me scroll down to see all projects and identify which ones have the most stars.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good, I can see more projects now. I notice:
- Primer / design: 21 stars (Developer role)
- empathy-prompts: 6 stars (Owner)
- millennials-to-snake-people: 6 stars (Owner)

Most others have 0-2 stars. Now I need to distinguish between:
1. Projects where I'm the Owner (my own projects)
2. Projects where I'm a Developer/Maintainer/Contributor (where I made contributions to someone else's project)

The key ones where I made contributions (not Owner) appear to be:
- Primer / design: 21 stars (Developer)
- The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com: 21 stars (Maintainer)

Let me scroll back up to see all the projects and make sure I have the complete list, especially to verify the roles and star counts.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled up by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I can see the key projects. Let me analyze the repositories where I made contributions (not Owner):

From what I can see:
1. **The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com** - 21 stars (Maintainer role)
2. **Primer / design** - 21 stars (Developer role)

These are the two repositories where I made contributions (as opposed to being the Owner) and they both have 21 stars, which is the highest star count among the contributed repositories.

However, I should check if there are any other projects I might have missed. Let me click on one of these to verify the full repository name, and also check if there's a way to see only contributed projects or sort by stars to make sure I have the complete picture.

Let me click on "The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com" to see its full details:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com project link with 21 stars and Maintainer badge'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I see the page is still loading. Let me wait a moment for it to fully load:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I can see the full repository name is **a11yproject.com** (The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com) and it has 21 stars. Now let me go back to check the Primer / design repository to get its full name as well.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'back button in browser navigation'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good, I'm back on the projects page. Now let me click on the Primer / design project to see its full details:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'Primer / design project link with 21 stars and Developer badge at the bottom of the visible list'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the URL shows it's loading the Primer/design page. Let me wait for it to load:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I can see the repository name is **design** (Primer / design) and it has 21 stars. 

Now I have confirmed the two repositories where I made contributions (not as Owner) that have the most stars:

1. **The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com** - 21 stars (Maintainer)
2. **Primer / design** - 21 stars (Developer)

Both have 21 stars, which is the highest among repositories where I contributed (but am not the Owner). However, I should verify if there are any other contributed repositories I might have missed. Let me go back to the projects page and check if there are any other projects with a role other than "Owner" that might have more stars or that I haven't seen yet.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'back button in browser navigation'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good, I'm back on the projects page. Let me scroll through the entire list one more time to make sure I haven't missed any repositories where I have a role other than "Owner" (like Developer, Maintainer, or Contributor). Let me scroll down to see all 19 projects:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'long'}
[result] Scrolled down by long distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I can now see the end of the list. Let me review all the projects I've seen and identify which ones have a role OTHER than "Owner":

From the complete list:
1. **The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com** - 21 stars (Maintainer)
2. **Primer / design** - 21 stars (Developer)

All other visible projects show "Owner" as the role, which means they are my own repositories, not repositories where I made contributions to someone else's project.

Both repositories where I made contributions have 21 stars each, which is tied for the most stars. These are the repositories where I contributed and they got the most stars.

Now I have the answer:
- **The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com** (also shown as just "a11yproject.com")
- **Primer / design** (also shown as just "design")
[tool] mcp__task-completion__complete_task: {'finalAnswer': 'The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com, Primer / design'}
[complete] The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com, Primer / design
The task is complete! I found the two repositories where you made contributions (as Maintainer/Developer, not Owner) that received the most stars:

1. **The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com** - 21 stars
2. **Primer / design** - 21 stars

Both repositories are tied with 21 stars each, making them the most-starred repositories among those where you contributed.</pre></div><div class='action_object' style='background-color:grey'><pre>{'action_type': <ActionTypes.STOP: 17>, 'coords': array([0., 0.], dtype=float32), 'element_role': 0, 'element_name': '', 'text': [], 'page_number': 0, 'url': '', 'nth': 0, 'pw_code': '', 'element_id': '', 'key_comb': '', 'direction': '', 'answer': 'The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com, Primer / design', 'raw_prediction': 'I\'ll help you find the repositories where you made contributions that got the most stars.
