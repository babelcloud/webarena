Good! I can see I'm on the Magento Admin dashboard. To find the customer who is most unhappy with "Circe fleece", I need to look at product reviews. In an e-commerce admin panel like Magento, customer reviews and ratings are typically found in the Marketing or Content section. Let me navigate to find reviews for the Circe fleece product.

Let me click on the "MARKETING" section in the left sidebar to see if reviews are there.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'MARKETING menu item in the left sidebar'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I can see the Marketing menu has opened and I can see "All Reviews" under the "User Content" section. Let me click on "All Reviews" to see all product reviews.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'All Reviews link under User Content section'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I see the page is loading (notice the loading indicator at the top). Let me wait a moment for the page to fully load before proceeding.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! Now I can see the Reviews page with 351 records found. I can see several reviews listed, and I notice there are reviews for "Circe Hooded Ice Fleece" in the Product column. I can see:

- Review ID 353: Hannah Lim - "I was really disappointed with the Circe Hooded..." - Product: Circe Hooded Ice Fleece
- Review ID 352: customer - "I recently purchased the Circe Hooded Ice Fleec..." - Product: Circe Hooded Ice Fleece

To find the most unhappy customer, I need to filter specifically for "Circe fleece" products and look at the ratings. Let me use the Product filter to search for "Circe" to narrow down the results.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Product input field in the filter row'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I see a dropdown has appeared. Let me click on the Product text input field to type "Circe" to filter for Circe fleece products.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Product input text field in the filter row at the bottom right'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good, now let me type "Circe" in the Product field to filter for Circe fleece products.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'content': 'Circe', 'pressEnterAfterType': False}
[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the text "Circe" has been typed but the field is not visible in the current view. Let me scroll right to see the Product filter field and then click the Search button to apply the filter.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Search button above the table on the left side'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The page is loading. Let me wait for it to complete loading.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'duration': 3000}
[result] Finished waiting for 3000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I see the page has loaded and it still shows "351 records found", which means the filter might not have been applied properly. Let me scroll right to see if the Product filter field shows "Circe" and if I need to reapply the filter.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'short'}
[result] Scrolled down by short distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I see that I've scrolled down and now I can see different products in the Product column - Chloe Compete Tank, Breathe-Easy Tank, Antonia Racer Tank, Bella Tank, Zoe Tank, Erika Running Short. I notice these are not "Circe" products. It seems the filter didn't work properly. Let me scroll back up to the top and try a different approach. Let me look for a way to sort by rating or look at the reviews more carefully.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled up by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I can see the reviews. I can see two reviews for "Circe Hooded Ice Fleece" at the top:
- Review ID 353: Hannah Lim - "I was really disappointed with the Circe Hooded..." - Status: Pending
- Review ID 352: customer - "I recently purchased the Circe Hooded Ice Fleec..." - Status: Pending

To find the "most unhappy" customer, I need to see the actual ratings/stars for these reviews. Let me click on one of these reviews to see the full details including the rating. Let me click on the first one (Hannah Lim's review).
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Edit link for review ID 353 by Hannah Lim'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The page is loading (I can see the loading spinner). Let me wait for it to load.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'duration': 3000}
[result] Finished waiting for 3000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I can now see the review details for Hannah Lim's review:
- Product: Circe Hooded Ice Fleece
- Author: Guest
- Summary Rating: 2 stars (★★ out of 5)
- Detailed Rating: 1 star (★ out of 5)
- Nickname: Hannah Lim
- Summary: "Bad!"
- Review: Very negative feedback about the product

This is a 1-star review, which is very low. However, I need to check the other review (ID 352) to compare and see which customer is the "most unhappy." Let me go back and check the other Circe fleece review.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Back button at the top'}

Good! I'm back at the reviews list. Now I can see the two Circe Hooded Ice Fleece reviews again:
- Review ID 353: Hannah Lim - "Bad!" (I already know this is a 1-star review)
- Review ID 352: customer - "Good but not perfect"

The second review's title is "Good but not perfect" which suggests it might be a higher rating than Hannah Lim's 1-star review. Let me click on review 352 to check its rating.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Edit link for review ID 352 by customer'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the page is loading. Let me wait for it to complete.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'duration': 3000}
[result] Finished waiting for 3000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I can see the second review for Circe Hooded Ice Fleece:
- Product: Circe Hooded Ice Fleece
- Author: Guest
- Summary Rating: 4 stars (★★★★ out of 5)
- Detailed Rating: 4 stars (★★★★ out of 5)
- Nickname: customer
- Summary: "Good but not perfect"
- Review: Positive overall, but mentions some minor issues

Now I've checked both reviews for the Circe fleece:
1. Hannah Lim - 1 star rating - "Bad!" - Very negative review
2. customer - 4 stars rating - "Good but not perfect" - Mostly positive review

Hannah Lim with a 1-star rating is clearly the most unhappy customer. However, I notice the "Nickname" field shows "customer" for the second review, which means the actual customer account might have an email address. Let me scroll down to see if there's customer contact information displayed, or I need to go back and look for a way to access the customer's email address.

Let me scroll down to see if there's more information on this page.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'short'}
[result] Scrolled down by short distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the review details but there's no email address shown on this page. The review was left by a "Guest" user with nickname "customer", so there might not be an email associated with this review, or it's not visible here. 

Since Hannah Lim gave the lowest rating (1 star) for the Circe fleece, she is the most unhappy customer. Now I need to find her email address. Let me go back to the reviews list and then look for the customer information. I should check if there's a way to view customer details or if the email is stored elsewhere.

Let me click "Previous" to go back to Hannah Lim's review to see if I can find her email address there.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Previous button at the top'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
It seems the page didn't change - I'm still on the same review (ID 352, the 4-star review). Let me scroll up and try clicking the "Next" button instead to navigate to the next review, which should be Hannah Lim's 1-star review (ID 353).
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'short'}
[result] Scrolled up by short distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! Now I'm looking at Hannah Lim's review (ID 353) - the 1-star review. I can see:
- Product: Circe Hooded Ice Fleece
- Author: Guest
- Summary Rating: 2 stars
- Detailed Rating: 1 star
- Nickname: Hannah Lim
- Summary: "Bad!"

However, I notice that the Author is listed as "Guest", which means this review was also left by a guest user, not a registered customer account. There's no email address visible on this review page either.

Let me scroll down to see if there's any additional information like an email field below.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'short'}
[result] Scrolled down by short distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the full review but there's no email address field visible on this page. Since both reviews were left by "Guest" users, the email addresses might not be stored in the review system, or they might be stored separately in the customer database.

Let me go back to the reviews list and look more carefully. Perhaps there's additional information I missed, or I need to access the customer database directly. Let me click "Back" to return to the reviews list.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Back button at the top'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The page is loading. Let me wait for it to complete.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'duration': 3000}
[result] Finished waiting for 3000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good, I'm back at the reviews list. I notice that in the "Type" column, most reviews show "Guest" but review ID 351 shows "Customer". This suggests that some reviews are from registered customers who have accounts with email addresses.

Let me look more carefully at the reviews for "Circe Hooded Ice Fleece". I can see:
- Review ID 353: Hannah Lim - Type: Guest
- Review ID 352: customer - Type: Guest

Both Circe fleece reviews are from Guest users, which might not have email addresses in the system. However, let me check if there's a way to see the email addresses of guest reviewers. Let me try looking at the "Customers" section in the left sidebar to see if I can search for "Hannah Lim" there.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'CUSTOMERS menu item in the left sidebar'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! The Customers menu has opened. I can see options like "All Customers". Let me click on "All Customers" to see the customer list and search for Hannah Lim.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'All Customers option in the Customers menu'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}

[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Search by keyword text input field'}

Let me use the Product filter to search for "Circe" to narrow down the results.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'target\': \'Product input field in the filter row\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI see a dropdown has appeared. Let me click on the Product text input field to type "Circe" to filter for Circe fleece products.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'target\': \'Product input text field in the filter row at the bottom right\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood, now let me type "Circe" in the Product field to filter for Circe fleece products.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'content\': \'Circe\', \'pressEnterAfterType\': False}\n[result] Text typed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI can see the text "Circe" has been typed but the field is not visible in the current view. Let me scroll right to see the Product filter field and then click the Search button to apply the filter.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'target\': \'Search button above the table on the left side\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nThe page is loading.

Let me scroll right to see if the Product filter field shows "Circe" and if I need to reapply the filter.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'direction\': \'down\', \'distance\': \'short\'}\n[result] Scrolled down by short distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI see that I\'ve scrolled down and now I can see different products in the Product column - Chloe Compete Tank, Breathe-Easy Tank, Antonia Racer Tank, Bella Tank, Zoe Tank, Erika Running Short. I notice these are not "Circe" products. It seems the filter didn\'t work properly. Let me scroll back up to the top and try a different approach. Let me look for a way to sort by rating or look at the reviews more carefully.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'direction\': \'up\', \'distance\': \'medium\'}\n[result] Scrolled up by medium distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect! Now I can see the reviews. I can see two reviews for "Circe Hooded Ice Fleece" at the top:\n- Review ID 353: Hannah Lim - "I was really disappointed with the Circe Hooded..." - Status: Pending\n- Review ID 352: customer - "I recently purchased the Circe Hooded Ice Fleec..." - Status: Pending\n\nTo find the "most unhappy" customer, I need to see the actual ratings/stars for these reviews. Let me click on one of these reviews to see the full details including the rating. Let me click on the first one (Hannah Lim\'s review).\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'target\': \'Edit link for review ID 353 by Hannah Lim\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nThe page is loading (I can see the loading spinner).

I can now see the review details for Hannah Lim\'s review:\n- Product: Circe Hooded Ice Fleece\n- Author: Guest\n- Summary Rating: 2 stars (★★ out of 5)\n- Detailed Rating: 1 star (★ out of 5)\n- Nickname: Hannah Lim\n- Summary: "Bad!"\n- Review: Very negative feedback about the product\n\nThis is a 1-star review, which is very low. However, I need to check the other review (ID 352) to compare and see which customer is the "most unhappy." Let me go back and check the other Circe fleece review.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'target\': \'Back button at the top\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI see the page is loading (blank content area). Let me wait for it to load completely.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'duration\': 3000}\n[result] Finished waiting for 3000ms. {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood! I\'m back at the reviews list. Now I can see the two Circe Hooded Ice Fleece reviews again:\n- Review ID 353: Hannah Lim - "Bad!" (I already know this is a 1-star review)\n- Review ID 352: customer - "Good but not perfect"\n\nThe second review\'s title is "Good but not perfect" which suggests it might be a higher rating than Hannah Lim\'s 1-star review. Let me click on review 352 to check its rating.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'target\': \'Edit link for review ID 352 by customer\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI can see the page is loading.

Now I can see the second review for Circe Hooded Ice Fleece:\n- Product: Circe Hooded Ice Fleece\n- Author: Guest\n- Summary Rating: 4 stars (★★★★ out of 5)\n- Detailed Rating: 4 stars (★★★★ out of 5)\n- Nickname: customer\n- Summary: "Good but not perfect"\n- Review: Positive overall, but mentions some minor issues\n\nNow I\'ve checked both reviews for the Circe fleece:\n1. Hannah Lim - 1 star rating - "Bad!" - Very negative review\n2. customer - 4 stars rating - "Good but not perfect" - Mostly positive review\n\nHannah Lim with a 1-star rating is clearly the most unhappy customer. However, I notice the "Nickname" field shows "customer" for the second review, which means the actual customer account might have an email address. Let me scroll down to see if there\'s customer contact information displayed, or I need to go back and look for a way to access the customer\'s email address.\n\nLet me scroll down to see if there\'s more information on this page.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'direction\': \'down\', \'distance\': \'short\'}\n[result] Scrolled down by short distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI can see the review details but there\'s no email address shown on this page. The review was left by a "Guest" user with nickname "customer", so there might not be an email associated with this review, or it\'s not visible here. \n\nSince Hannah Lim gave the lowest rating (1 star) for the Circe fleece, she is the most unhappy customer. Now I need to find her email address. Let me go back to the reviews list and then look for the customer information. I should check if there\'s a way to view customer details or if the email is stored elsewhere.\n\nLet me click "Previous" to go back to Hannah Lim\'s review to see if I can find her email address there.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'target\': \'Previous button at the top\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nIt seems the page didn\'t change - I\'m still on the same review (ID 352, the 4-star review). Let me scroll up and try clicking the "Next" button instead to navigate to the next review, which should be Hannah Lim\'s 1-star review (ID 353).\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'direction\': \'up\', \'distance\': \'short\'}\n[result] Scrolled up by short distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nExcellent! Now I\'m looking at Hannah Lim\'s review (ID 353) - the 1-star review. I can see:\n- Product: Circe Hooded Ice Fleece\n- Author: Guest\n- Summary Rating: 2 stars\n- Detailed Rating: 1 star\n- Nickname: Hannah Lim\n- Summary: "Bad!"\n\nHowever, I notice that the Author is listed as "Guest", which means this review was also left by a guest user, not a registered customer account. There\'s no email address visible on this review page either.\n\nLet me scroll down to see if there\'s any additional information like an email field below.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'direction\': \'down\', \'distance\': \'short\'}\n[result] Scrolled down by short distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI can see the full review but there\'s no email address field visible on this page. Since both reviews were left by "Guest" users, the email addresses might not be stored in the review system, or they might be stored separately in the customer database.\n\nLet me go back to the reviews list and look more carefully. Perhaps there\'s additional information I missed, or I need to access the customer database directly. Let me click "Back" to return to the reviews list.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'target\': \'Back button at the top\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nThe page is loading.

I notice that in the "Type" column, most reviews show "Guest" but review ID 351 shows "Customer". This suggests that some reviews are from registered customers who have accounts with email addresses.\n\nLet me look more carefully at the reviews for "Circe Hooded Ice Fleece". I can see:\n- Review ID 353: Hannah Lim - Type: Guest\n- Review ID 352: customer - Type: Guest\n\nBoth Circe fleece reviews are from Guest users, which might not have email addresses in the system. However, let me check if there\'s a way to see the email addresses of guest reviewers. Let me try looking at the "Customers" section in the left sidebar to see if I can search for "Hannah Lim" there.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'target\': \'CUSTOMERS menu item in the left sidebar\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect! The Customers menu has opened. I can see options like "All Customers". Let me click on "All Customers" to see the customer list and search for Hannah Lim.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'target\': \'All Customers option in the Customers menu\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nThe page is loading.

Now I can see the Customers page with 70 records found. I can see a list of customers with their email addresses. Now I need to search for "Hannah Lim" to find her email address. Let me use the search box at the top to search for "Hannah Lim".\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'target\': \'Search by keyword text input field\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood!
