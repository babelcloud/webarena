Good! I can see I'm already on the Postmill website (a Reddit-like platform). I can see there's a tab open with Postmill. The current page shows the home feed with various posts. I can see subscribed forums on the right side, and I need to find a subreddit for relations where I can ask for advice about sexual harassment.

Looking at the subscribed forums, I don't see a relations-focused subreddit yet. Let me look for one. I should search for or navigate to a relations/relationships subreddit. Let me use the search bar to find a relevant subreddit.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'search bar with red border in the top navigation'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good, I've clicked on the search bar and it's now active (I can see the cursor in the white search field). Let me search for a relations or relationships subreddit.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'content': 'relations', 'pressEnterAfterType': True}
[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see that I typed "relations" in the search bar and pressed enter. The page seems to be loading (I can see the loading indicator in the browser tab). Let me wait for the search results to load.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the page is still loading (there's a loading indicator in the tab). The search doesn't seem to have executed or the results haven't loaded yet. Let me try clicking on "Forums" in the navigation to browse available forums/subreddits instead.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Forums link in the red navigation bar at the top'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! The search results have loaded. I can see "50 results for relations:" and the search has shown posts containing the word "relations" or "related". However, I need to find a subreddit/forum specifically about relations or relationships, not just posts with the word "relations" in them.

Let me go back and browse the Forums section to see all available forums. I'll click on the "Forums" link in the navigation.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Forums link in the red navigation bar'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I can now see the list of forums. I can see there's a forum called **"relationship_advice"** (/r/relationship_advice) which is exactly what I need! This is a subreddit for relations where I can ask for advice about sexual harassment. Let me click on it.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'relationship_advice link with the text "/r/relationship_advice" in red'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! I'm now in the /r/relationship_advice subreddit. I can see the forum page with existing posts about relationships. Now I need to create a new post to ask for advice about sexual harassment. I can see there's a "+ Submit" button in the top navigation bar. Let me click on it to create a new post.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': '+ Submit button in the red navigation bar at the top'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the page has changed and the URL shows "submit/relationship_advice", which indicates I'm on the submission page. However, I don't see the submission form on the screen yet. Let me scroll up to see if there's a form at the top of the page.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'long'}
[result] Scrolled up by long distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I can see the "Create submission" form with:
- URL field (optional)
- Title field (required, marked with *)
- Body field (large text area)
- Forum dropdown (already set to "relationship_advice")
- "Create submission" button

Now I need to fill in the form to ask for advice about sexual harassment. Let me start by clicking on the Title field and entering a title.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Title text input field below the label "Title *"'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! The Title field is now focused (I can see it has a red border indicating it's active). Now I'll type a title for my post asking for advice about sexual harassment.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'content': 'Need advice: Experiencing sexual harassment at work', 'pressEnterAfterType': False}
[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I've entered the title "Need advice: Experiencing sexual harassment at work" in the Title field. Now I need to click on the Body field and add some content describing the situation to make it a complete post asking for advice.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Body text area field below the label "Body"'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! The Body field is now focused (I can see the red border around it). Now I'll type some content asking for advice about sexual harassment.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'content': "I'm experiencing sexual harassment from a coworker and I'm not sure how to handle this situation. It's been making me very uncomfortable and affecting my work. What steps should I take? Should I report this to HR? Has anyone dealt with something similar? I would really appreciate any advice on how to address this professionally and protect myself.", 'pressEnterAfterType': False}
[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! I've successfully filled in both the Title and Body fields with a post asking for advice about sexual harassment. The form now contains:

- **Title**: "Need advice: Experiencing sexual harassment at work"
- **Body**: "I'm experiencing sexual harassment from a coworker and I'm not sure how to handle this situation. It's been making me very uncomfortable and affecting my work. What steps should I take? Should I report this to HR? Has anyone dealt with something similar? I would really appreciate any advice on how to address this professionally and protect myself."
- **Forum**: "relationship_advice" (already set)

Now I need to click the "Create submission" button to post this to the subreddit.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Create submission button in red at the bottom of the form'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Great! I can see that clicking the "Create submission" button has triggered a preview section to appear. The page now shows a "Preview" section displaying how the post will look once submitted. I can see my content is there, and the "Create submission" button is still visible at the bottom. Let me scroll down to see if I need to confirm or if there's another step, and then click the "Create submission" button again to finalize the post.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'short'}
[result] Scrolled down by short distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! The post has been successfully created and submitted! I can see that:
