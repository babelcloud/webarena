I can see the browser is on the "One Stop Market" e-commerce website. I need to search for phone cases from the brand "EYZUTAK" and find reviews with 1 or 2 stars. Let me search for this using the search bar.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': 'Search bar with placeholder text "Search entire store here..."'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good, the search bar is now focused. Let me type "EYZUTAK phone case" to search for products from this brand.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'content': 'EYZUTAK phone case', 'pressEnterAfterType': True}
[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the search suggestions appearing with "EYZUTAK phone case" and "EYZUTAK phone cases" options. Let me wait for the search results to load.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! The search results show "Items 1-12 of 12805" for EYZUTAK phone cases. I can see several phone case products. Now I need to look at the reviews for these products to find 1 or 2 star reviews. Let me scroll down to see more products and then click on individual products to check their reviews.

Let me click on the first product to check its reviews:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': 'EYZUTAK Electroplated Magnetic Ring Holder Case product image on the left'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I'm now on a product page for an EYZUTAK phone case. I can see it has a 4-star rating. I need to scroll down to see the reviews section where I can find 1 or 2 star reviews and see who wrote them.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I can see a "Reviews (12)" tab at the top. Let me click on it to see all the reviews for this product.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': 'Reviews (12) tab'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! I can see the Customer Reviews section. I can see:

1. First review: "Cute but, the ring broke quickly" - Rating: 3 stars (not 1 or 2 stars) - by Lisa Lee
2. Second review: "Gray color is so chic" - Rating: 5 stars - by MH
3. Third review (partially visible): "Not what it looks like"

I need to scroll down to see more reviews and find those with 1 or 2 stars. Let me continue scrolling.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I can now see more reviews. I've found two reviews with 2 stars:

1. **"Read"** - Rating: 2 stars - "The gold is already peeling out and I've only had it for 3 weeks" - Review by **Evelyn Kurver** - Posted on 4/20/23

2. **"Cute but only for a short time"** - Rating: 2 stars - "Do not buy this. Trust me! I wanted to ignore the negative reviews and hope it would work at least for a couple months but it didn't. It started chipping right away. The ring holder was too tight and first, then it was nice for a while, then it loosened completely and just dangled from my phone so I had to immediately replace it. Don't waste your money." - Review by **N Randall** - Posted on 4/20/23

Let me continue scrolling to check if there are more 1 or 2 star reviews:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see more reviews here, but these are 4-5 star reviews. I can see there's pagination at the bottom showing "1 2" with an arrow, indicating there are more reviews on page 2. However, I've only checked one product so far. Since the task asks about "phone cases from EYZUTAK" (plural), I should check if there might be a way to see all reviews across products or if I need to check multiple products.

Let me first check if this product has all the reviews by going to page 2:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': 'Page 2 link in pagination'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I'm now on page 2 of the reviews. I can see the same two reviews I found earlier:
- Bethany Robertson (5 stars)
- N Randall (2 stars)

This appears to be all 12 reviews for this specific product. So far I've found **2 reviewers with 2-star ratings**:
1. **Evelyn Kurver**
2. **N Randall**

However, the task asks about "phone cases from EYZUTAK" (plural), which might mean I should check if there are other EYZUTAK phone case products with 1 or 2 star reviews. Let me go back to the search results to check other products. Let me use the back button to return to the search results.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'keys': ['alt', 'arrowLeft']}
[result] Keys pressed successfully
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502'}
[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I'm back at the search results page showing EYZUTAK phone cases. I can see there are 12,805 items. Rather than checking each product individually (which would take too long), let me think about this more systematically. 

The task asks "Who gave 1 or 2 stars for phone cases from EYZUTAK". This likely means I should look across all EYZUTAK phone case products. However, checking 12,805 products individually isn't feasible. 

Let me see if there's a way to filter reviews by rating. Let me scroll down to see if there are filter options on the left sidebar.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see more EYZUTAK phone case products here. Looking at this page, I notice the top product shows "12 Reviews" which is the same product I already checked. Let me try a different approach. 

Since the task is asking who gave 1 or 2 stars for phone cases from EYZUTAK, and I've found 2 people on the first product I checked, let me verify if there's a way to see ALL reviews across all EYZUTAK products, or if I should check a few more products to be thorough.

Let me scroll back up and look for any rating filter options on the left sidebar:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'long'}
[result] Scrolled up by long distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the left sidebar has "Shopping Options" with a "Category" section, but I don't see a rating filter here. Let me check if I need to click on "Shop By" to expand more filter options, or if I should use the "Advanced Search" link at the top right.

Actually, thinking about this more carefully: the task is asking "Who gave 1 or 2 stars for phone cases from EYZUTAK". Given that there are 12,805 products, it's likely that the question is asking about a specific context or set of reviews that would be visible/accessible. 

Based on what I've found so far on the first product (which had 12 reviews and appeared to be a popular item), I found:
- **Evelyn Kurver** - 2 stars
- **N Randall** - 2 stars

Let me check if there's a way to see all reviews or if I should check a couple more products. Let me try the "Advanced Search" to see if there are rating filters:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': 'Advanced Search link'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The page didn't change - the Advanced Search link might not have worked as expected. Let me try a different approach. Let me check a couple more EYZUTAK phone case products to see if there are more 1 or 2 star reviews. Let me click on the second product.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': 'RTlink Phone Case for Motorola Moto g Pure/Motorola Moto g Power (2022) product image'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I notice the page is still loading (there's a loading indicator in the tab). Let me wait a moment and then take a screenshot:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I see this RTlink product page loaded, but it says "Be the first to review this product" - so there are no reviews for this product. This is not an EYZUTAK product anyway (it's RTlink brand). Let me go back to the search results and check another EYZUTAK product.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'keys': ['alt', 'arrowLeft']}
[result] Keys pressed successfully
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502'}
[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good, I'm back at the search results. Looking at the visible products, I can see:
1. EYZUTAK Electroplated Magnetic Ring Holder Case (12 Reviews) - I already checked this one
2. RTlink Phone Case (not EYZUTAK brand)
3. Anime Girls Phone Case (not clearly EYZUTAK)
4. Hemobllo Diving Phone Case (not EYZUTAK)

Let me try clicking on "EYZUTAK phone cases" link in the "Related search terms" section to see if I can get a better filtered view of actual EYZUTAK products:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': 'EYZUTAK phone cases link in Related search terms'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The page is still loading. Let me wait for it to complete:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! Now the search shows "EYZUTAK phone cases" with the same 12,805 items. The results are similar. I can see only the first product (EYZUTAK Electroplated Magnetic Ring Holder Case) is clearly an EYZUTAK brand product with reviews.

Given the context of the task and the fact that:
1. There are 12,805 search results
2. Most products don't have the EYZUTAK brand clearly visible or have no reviews
3. I found the main EYZUTAK product with 12 reviews that has 2 people who gave 1-2 star ratings

Let me check if I should interpret this differently. Perhaps the task is asking about a specific, more limited set. Let me click on the "EYZUTAK" link under "Related search terms" to see if that gives me a more focused brand page:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': 'EYZUTAK link under Related search terms'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! Now I have a much more focused view. The search for just "EYZUTAK" shows only "1 item" - which is the EYZUTAK Electroplated Magnetic Ring Holder Case with 12 Reviews. This is the product I already thoroughly checked!

So based on this search showing only 1 EYZUTAK product on this website (the phone case with 12 reviews), the answer to "Who gave 1 or 2 stars for phone cases from EYZUTAK" is:

- **Evelyn Kurver** (gave 2 stars)
- **N Randall** (gave 2 stars)

These are the only two people who gave 1 or 2 star reviews for EYZUTAK phone cases on this website.
[tool] mcp__task-completion__complete_task: {'finalAnswer': 'Evelyn Kurver, N Randall'}
[complete] Evelyn Kurver, N Randall
Task completed! I found that **Evelyn Kurver** and **N Randall** were the two customers who gave 1 or 2 star reviews for phone cases from EYZUTAK. Both gave 2-star ratings on the EYZUTAK Electroplated Magnetic Ring Holder Case product.</pre></div><div class='action_object' style='background-color:grey'><pre>{'action_type': <ActionTypes.STOP: 17>, 'coords': array([0., 0.], dtype=float32), 'element_role': 0, 'element_name': '', 'text': [], 'page_number': 0, 'url': '', 'nth': 0, 'pw_code': '', 'element_id': '', 'key_comb': '', 'direction': '', 'answer': 'Evelyn Kurver, N Randall', 'raw_prediction': 'I\'ll help you find who gave 1 or 2 stars for phone cases from EYZUTAK.

Don\'t waste your money." - Review by **N Randall** - Posted on 4/20/23\n\nLet me continue scrolling to check if there are more 1 or 2 star reviews:\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502\', \'direction\': \'down\', \'distance\': \'medium\'}\n[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI can see more reviews here, but these are 4-5 star reviews. I can see there\'s pagination at the bottom showing "1 2" with an arrow, indicating there are more reviews on page 2. However, I\'ve only checked one product so far. Since the task asks about "phone cases from EYZUTAK" (plural), I should check if there might be a way to see all reviews across products or if I need to check multiple products.\n\nLet me first check if this product has all the reviews by going to page 2:\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502\', \'target\': \'Page 2 link in pagination\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood! I\'m now on page 2 of the reviews. I can see the same two reviews I found earlier:\n- Bethany Robertson (5 stars)\n- N Randall (2 stars)\n\nThis appears to be all 12 reviews for this specific product. So far I\'ve found **2 reviewers with 2-star ratings**:\n1. **Evelyn Kurver**\n2. **N Randall**\n\nHowever, the task asks about "phone cases from EYZUTAK" (plural), which might mean I should check if there are other EYZUTAK phone case products with 1 or 2 star reviews. Let me go back to the search results to check other products. Let me use the back button to return to the search results.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {\'boxId\': \'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502\', \'keys\': [\'alt\', \'arrowLeft\']}\n[result] Keys pressed successfully\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {\'boxId\': \'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502\'}\n[result] {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect! I\'m back at the search results page showing EYZUTAK phone cases. I can see there are 12,805 items. Rather than checking each product individually (which would take too long), let me think about this more systematically. \n\nThe task asks "Who gave 1 or 2 stars for phone cases from EYZUTAK". This likely means I should look across all EYZUTAK phone case products. However, checking 12,805 products individually isn\'t feasible. \n\nLet me see if there\'s a way to filter reviews by rating. Let me scroll down to see if there are filter options on the left sidebar.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502\', \'direction\': \'down\', \'distance\': \'medium\'}\n[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI can see more EYZUTAK phone case products here. Looking at this page, I notice the top product shows "12 Reviews" which is the same product I already checked. Let me try a different approach. \n\nSince the task is asking who gave 1 or 2 stars for phone cases from EYZUTAK, and I\'ve found 2 people on the first product I checked, let me verify if there\'s a way to see ALL reviews across all EYZUTAK products, or if I should check a few more products to be thorough.\n\nLet me scroll back up and look for any rating filter options on the left sidebar:\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502\', \'direction\': \'up\', \'distance\': \'long\'}\n[result] Scrolled up by long distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI can see the left sidebar has "Shopping Options" with a "Category" section, but I don\'t see a rating filter here. Let me check if I need to click on "Shop By" to expand more filter options, or if I should use the "Advanced Search" link at the top right.\n\nActually, thinking about this more carefully: the task is asking "Who gave 1 or 2 stars for phone cases from EYZUTAK". Given that there are 12,805 products, it\'s likely that the question is asking about a specific context or set of reviews that would be visible/accessible. \n\nBased on what I\'ve found so far on the first product (which had 12 reviews and appeared to be a popular item), I found:\n- **Evelyn Kurver** - 2 stars\n- **N Randall** - 2 stars\n\nLet me check if there\'s a way to see all reviews or if I should check a couple more products. Let me try the "Advanced Search" to see if there are rating filters:\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502\', \'target\': \'Advanced Search link\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nThe page didn\'t change - the Advanced Search link might not have worked as expected. Let me try a different approach. Let me check a couple more EYZUTAK phone case products to see if there are more 1 or 2 star reviews. Let me click on the second product.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502\', \'target\': \'RTlink Phone Case for Motorola Moto g Pure/Motorola Moto g Power (2022) product image\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI notice the page is still loading (there\'s a loading indicator in the tab). Let me wait a moment and then take a screenshot:\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {\'boxId\': \'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502\', \'duration\': 2000}\n[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI see this RTlink product page loaded, but it says "Be the first to review this product" - so there are no reviews for this product. This is not an EYZUTAK product anyway (it\'s RTlink brand). Let me go back to the search results and check another EYZUTAK product.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {\'boxId\': \'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502\', \'keys\': [\'alt\', \'arrowLeft\']}\n[result] Keys pressed successfully\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {\'boxId\': \'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502\'}\n[result] {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood, I\'m back at the search results. Looking at the visible products, I can see:\n1. EYZUTAK Electroplated Magnetic Ring Holder Case (12 Reviews) - I already checked this one\n2. RTlink Phone Case (not EYZUTAK brand)\n3. Anime Girls Phone Case (not clearly EYZUTAK)\n4. Hemobllo Diving Phone Case (not EYZUTAK)\n\nLet me try clicking on "EYZUTAK phone cases" link in the "Related search terms" section to see if I can get a better filtered view of actual EYZUTAK products:\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502\', \'target\': \'EYZUTAK phone cases link in Related search terms\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nThe page is still loading. Let me wait for it to complete:\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {\'boxId\': \'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502\', \'duration\': 2000}\n[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood! Now the search shows "EYZUTAK phone cases" with the same 12,805 items. The results are similar. I can see only the first product (EYZUTAK Electroplated Magnetic Ring Holder Case) is clearly an EYZUTAK brand product with reviews.\n\nGiven the context of the task and the fact that:\n1. There are 12,805 search results\n2. Most products don\'t have the EYZUTAK brand clearly visible or have no reviews\n3. I found the main EYZUTAK product with 12 reviews that has 2 people who gave 1-2 star ratings\n\nLet me check if I should interpret this differently. Perhaps the task is asking about a specific, more limited set. Let me click on the "EYZUTAK" link under "Related search terms" to see if that gives me a more focused brand page:\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502\', \'target\': \'EYZUTAK link under Related search terms\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nExcellent! Now I have a much more focused view. The search for just "EYZUTAK" shows only "1 item" - which is the EYZUTAK Electroplated Magnetic Ring Holder Case with 12 Reviews. This is the product I already thoroughly checked!\n\nSo based on this search showing only 1 EYZUTAK product on this website (the phone case with 12 reviews), the answer to "Who gave 1 or 2 stars for phone cases from EYZUTAK" is:\n\n- **Evelyn Kurver** (gave 2 stars)\n- **N Randall** (gave 2 stars)\n\nThese are the only two people who gave 1 or 2 star reviews for EYZUTAK phone cases on this website.\n[tool] mcp__task-completion__complete_task: {\'finalAnswer\': \'Evelyn Kurver, N Randall\'}\n[complete] Evelyn Kurver, N Randall\nTask completed! I found that **Evelyn Kurver** and **N Randall** were the two customers who gave 1 or 2 star reviews for phone cases from EYZUTAK. Both gave 2-star ratings on the EYZUTAK Electroplated Magnetic Ring Holder Case product.'}</pre></div><div class='parsed_action' style='background-color:yellow'><pre>stop [Evelyn Kurver, N Randall]</pre></div></div>
