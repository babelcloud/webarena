However, let me go back to the search results to see if there are other options with capacities closer to 40 cards (like 40, 48, or 50 card cases) that might be more suitable or cost-effective. Let me scroll down to see if there are related products.

3. **HEIYING Game Card Case for Nintendo Switch& Switch OLED** with 24 card slots

The third option mentions "24 card slots" which is closer to 40 but still too small. Let me look at other products on the page to find one that can hold exactly 40 or more cards. Let me scroll down to see more products.

Let me search more specifically for cases that can hold 40+ cards. Let me try a more specific search.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'Search input field at the top of the page'}
