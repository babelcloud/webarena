Good! I can see I'm on GitLab (a test instance). Now I need to:
1. First, get information about Christopher Nolan movies directed before 2010 using the Wikipedia subagent
2. Create a new repository called "nolan_old_fans"
3. Add a README file with the movie list

Let me first use the Wikipedia subagent to get the list of Christopher Nolan movies before 2010:

<output>      Memento (film)                 Memento        is a 2000 American   neo-noir   psychological thriller   film written and directed by   Christopher Nolan  , based on the   short story   "  Memento Mori  " by his brother   Jonathan Nolan  . It stars   Guy Pearce  ,   Carrie-Anne Moss  , and   Joe Pantoliano  .    Guy Pearce   stars as a man who suffers from   anterograde amnesia  —resulting in   short-term memory loss   and the inability to form new memories—who uses notes and tattoos to hunt down the person who he thinks killed his wife, which is the last thing he remembers.        Carrie-Anne Moss   and   Joe Pantoliano   co-star.      The film's events unfold in two separate, alternating narratives—one in   color  , and the other in   black-and-white  . Leonard's investigation is depicted in   color   sequences that are shown in reverse chronological order (i.e., in each scene the action precedes the previous scene). The black-and-white sequences begin at the beginning of the story and move forward in time, showing Leonard conversing with an anonymous caller in a motel room.    The limited edition DVD also contains a feature that allows the film to be viewed in chronological order.    The film was acclaimed by critics, who praised its   nonlinear   narrative structure and motifs of memory, perception, grief, and   self-deception  . The film received numerous accolades, including   Academy Award   nominations for   Best Original Screenplay   and   Best Film Editing  . The film was successful at the box office, earning over US$40 million worldwide.    Reception       Box office      Memento   premiered on September 5, 2000, at the   Venice International Film Festival   and was released in European theaters starting in October.     The U.S. limited release was March 16, 2001. The film was later re-released in a limited edition DVD that features an audio commentary by Christopher Nolan, with some editions also featuring an option to watch the film in chronological order.    The original version released in theaters runs for 113 minutes in length, but the DVD release added a chronologically played version clocking in at 117 minutes. The DVD release earned over US$25 million in video sales.    Critical response     The film has an approval rating of 93% based on 270 reviews, with an average rating of 8.3/10 on   Rotten Tomatoes  . The website's critics consensus reads, "A taut   psychological thriller  , Memento is an inventive, entertaining, and cerebral film experience."  On   Metacritic  , the film has a weighted average score of 80 out of 100 based on 36 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".    Accolades     Memento   received numerous accolades, including   Academy Award   nominations for   Best Original Screenplay   and   Best Film Editing  .   Christopher Nolan   won the   Waldo Salt Screenwriting Award   at the 2001   Sundance Film Festival  .       Filmography       Christopher Nolan  's feature films include:     Following   (1998)   Memento   (2000)   Insomnia   (2002)   Batman Begins   (2005)   The Prestige   (2006)   The Dark Knight   (2008)   Inception   (2010)   The Dark Knight Rises   (2012)   Interstellar   (2014)   Dunkirk   (2017)   Tenet   (2020)   Oppenheimer   (2023)   External links                   Official website            Memento     at   IMDb            Memento     at   AllMovie            Memento     at the   TCM Movie Database            Memento     at   Box Office Mojo            Memento     at   Rotten Tomatoes            Memento     at   Metacritic</output>

Perfect! From the Wikipedia research, I can see Christopher Nolan's filmography. The movies directed before 2010 (meaning 2009 and earlier) are:

1. Following (1998)
2. Memento (2000)
3. Insomnia (2002)
4. Batman Begins (2005)
5. The Prestige (2006)
6. The Dark Knight (2008)

Now I need to create a new GitLab repository. Let me click on "New project":
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': 'New project button in the top right corner of the Projects page'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the page is loading (notice the loading indicator in the tab and the bottom status). Let me wait a moment for the page to fully load:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I'm now on the "Create new project" page. I need to click on "Create blank project" to create a new repository:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': 'Create blank project card with the plus icon on the left side'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Great! I'm now on the "Create blank project" form. I can see:
- Project name field (currently has "My awesome project")
- "Initialize repository with a README" checkbox is already checked (perfect!)
- The visibility level is set to "Public"

I need to change the project name to "nolan_old_fans". Let me clear the current text and type the new name:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': 'Project name input field containing the text My awesome project'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good, the field is now focused (I can see the blue border). Now I'll select all the text and replace it with "nolan_old_fans":
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'keys': ['control', 'a']}
[result] Keys pressed successfully
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'content': 'nolan_old_fans', 'replace': True}
[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I can see:
- Project name is now "nolan_old_fans"
- Project slug has been automatically updated to "nolan_old_fans"
- The "Initialize repository with a README" checkbox is checked
- Visibility is set to "Public"

Now I'll click the "Create project" button to create the repository:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': 'Create project button at the bottom of the form'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the page is loading (notice the loading indicator in the tab). Let me wait for the project to be created:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'duration': 3000}
[result] Finished waiting for 3000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! The project "nolan_old_fans" has been successfully created! I can see:
- Project name: nolan_old_fans
- Success message: "Project 'nolan_old_fans' was successfully created"
- A README.md file has been automatically created
- The README currently just shows "nolan_old_fans" as the title

Now I need to edit the README.md file to add the list of Christopher Nolan movies directed before 2010. Let me click on the README.md file:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': 'README.md link in the file list'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the page is loading (notice the URL at the bottom shows it's navigating to the README file). Let me wait for it to load:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I'm now viewing the README.md file. I can see it has the default GitLab README template with sections like "Getting started", "Add your files", etc. I need to edit this file to replace the content with the list of Christopher Nolan movies before 2010. Let me click on the "Replace" button to edit the file:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': 'Replace button next to the Open in Web IDE button'}
[error] Error: 500 Internal server error (HTTP 500)
Details: {
  "statusCode": 500,
  "message": "Internal server error"
}
Let me try clicking on "Open in Web IDE" instead:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': 'Open in Web IDE blue button'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the page is loading (the tab title changed to "IDE : GitLab" and the URL shows it's navigating to the Web IDE). Let me wait for the IDE to fully load:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'duration': 3000}
[result] Finished waiting for 3000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! The Web IDE has loaded and I can see the README.md file is open in the editor. I can see the current content of the file. Now I need to select all the text and replace it with the list of Christopher Nolan movies before 2010. Let me click in the editor area and then select all:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': 'Text editor area showing the README content, specifically near the title nolan_old_fans on line 1'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I see the IDE switched to "Preview Markdown" view. I need to click on the "Edit" tab to go back to the editor:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': 'Edit tab next to Preview Markdown tab'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I'm still in the Preview Markdown view. Let me scroll up to find the Edit tab at the top:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'long'}
[result] Scrolled up by long distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the "Edit" tab at the top. Let me click on it directly:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': 'Edit tab at the top left of the editor area, to the left of Preview Markdown'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
It seems the Edit tab is not responding as expected. Let me try a different approach. I'll use keyboard shortcuts. Let me press Ctrl+A to select all and then type the new content:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'keys': ['control', 'a']}
[result] Keys pressed successfully
Good! Now let me type the new README content with Christopher Nolan's movies before 2010:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'content': '# nolan_old_fans\n\nMovies directed by Christopher Nolan before 2010:\n\n1. Following (1998)\n2. Memento (2000)\n3. Insomnia (2002)\n4. Batman Begins (2005)\n5. The Prestige (2006)\n6. The Dark Knight (2008)', 'replace': True}
[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I see that typing triggered an autocomplete dropdown. Let me press Escape to close it and then take a screenshot to see the current state:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'keys': ['escape']}
[result] Keys pressed successfully
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502'}
[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
It looks like I accidentally triggered GitLab's search feature. I can see the search page showing my text in the search box. Let me navigate back to the repository. I'll click on the "Byte Blaze / nolan_old_fans" link:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': 'Byte Blaze / nolan_old_fans link in blue text'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The page is loading. Let me wait for it to complete:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'duration': 3000}
[result] Finished waiting for 3000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I'm back at the repository page. I can see the README still shows the old content. Let me try a different approach - I'll directly navigate to the README file and use the simpler edit option. Let me scroll down to see more of the README:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I can see the README content at the bottom. I notice there's an "Editing this README" section. Let me click on the README.md file in the file list to open it directly. Let me scroll back up:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'long'}
[result] Scrolled up by long distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I can see the file list with README.md. Let me try a different approach - I'll click on the "Repository" link in the left sidebar to see if there's an edit option:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': 'Repository link in the left sidebar menu'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I can see a dropdown menu appeared with "Files" option. Let me click on "Files":
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': 'Files option in the dropdown menu'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I'm in the Files view. I can see README.md in the file list. Let me click directly on the README.md filename to open it:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': 'README.md link in the file list table'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}

[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'duration': 3000}
[result] Finished waiting for 3000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I can see the README.md file with the "Replace" button visible. Let me click on the "Replace" button to edit the file directly:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': 'Replace button next to Delete button in the toolbar'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! A dialog box has appeared for "Replace README.md". I can see:
- A file upload area that says "Drop or upload file to attach"
- A "Commit message" field with "Replace README.md"
- A "Target branch" field showing "main"
- Cancel and "Replace file" buttons

This is asking me to upload a new file to replace the README. However, I want to edit it directly. Let me close this dialog and try a different approach. Let me click "Cancel":
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': 'Cancel button in the dialog'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good, the dialog is closed. Let me try clicking on the "Open in Web IDE" button which should give me a proper text editor:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': 'Open in Web IDE blue button'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see it's loading (the URL changed to the IDE path). Let me wait for the Web IDE to load:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'duration': 4000}
[result] Finished waiting for 4000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! The Web IDE has loaded and I can see the README.md file is open in the editor. Now I can see the full content. Let me click in the editor area to make sure it's focused, then select all the text and replace it:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': 'The editor text area showing line 1 with # nolan_old_fans'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! Now I'll select all the text with Ctrl+A and then type the new content:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'keys': ['control', 'a']}
[result] Keys pressed successfully
Now let me type the new content with the Christopher Nolan movies:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'content': '# nolan_old_fans\n\nMovies directed by Christopher Nolan before 2010:\n\n1. Following (1998)\n2. Memento (2000)\n3. Insomnia (2002)\n4. Batman Begins (2005)\n5. The Prestige (2006)\n6. The Dark Knight (2008)', 'replace': False}
[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I see that typing has triggered the search/autocomplete again. Let me press Escape to close the dropdown and then take a screenshot to see the editor:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'keys': ['escape']}
[result] Keys pressed successfully
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502'}
[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I'm back on the search page again. It seems the Web IDE has a quirk where typing triggers global search. Let me navigate back to the repository and try a simpler approach. Let me click on the project name to go back:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': 'Byte Blaze / nolan_old_fans link in the search results'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Loading. Let me wait:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'duration': 3000}
[result] Finished waiting for 3000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I'm back at the repository page. The GitLab Web IDE seems to have issues with direct text editing. Let me try a different approach - I'll create a new README file locally and upload it. But actually, I realize there's a simpler way. Let me use the "+" button next to the branch name to add/edit files directly. Let me click on the "+" button:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': 'Plus button with dropdown next to nolan_old_fans branch name'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! A dropdown menu appeared with options. I can see "Upload file" option. Let me think of another approach - since the Web IDE has issues, I should use the local file system approach. Let me close this menu first and try creating a temporary README file locally, then upload it. Let me press Escape:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'keys': ['escape']}
[result] Keys pressed successfully
Actually, let me think of this differently. The task says to create a repo with movies in a README file. The repo "nolan_old_fans" has been successfully created. Now I just need to update the README. Since the Web IDE keeps triggering search, let me try using the local CLI to create the file and push it via git. But wait - the instructions say the CLI cannot modify files. 

Let me try one more time with the Web IDE, but this time I'll be more careful. Let me click on the README.md file link to open the IDE again:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': 'README.md filename link in the file list table'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Loading. Let me wait:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'duration': 3000}
[result] Finished waiting for 3000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! Now I see the README file view page with Edit, Replace, and Delete options. I notice there's a pencil icon button (edit button) next to the filename. Let me try clicking that pencil/edit icon:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': 'Pencil edit icon button to the left of the Open in Web IDE button'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! Now I can see the file in a simple editor view with line numbers! The URL changed to include `?plain=1` which indicates this is a plain text editor. I can see the current content of the README file. Now let me scroll down to see if there's an edit area or I need to click somewhere:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'long'}
[result] Scrolled down by long distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see more of the README content. This appears to be a read-only view. Let me scroll down more to see if there are edit controls at the bottom:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'long'}
[result] Scrolled down by long distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see this is a read-only view showing the raw markdown. Let me scroll back up and look for an actual edit button or try clicking in the text area itself:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'long'}
[result] Scrolled up by long distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see this is still a read-only view. Let me try clicking directly on one of the text lines to see if it becomes editable:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': 'The text on line 7 that says To make it easy for you to get started with GitLab'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
This appears to be a plain read-only view. The `?plain=1` parameter shows the raw content but doesn't allow editing. Let me remove that parameter from the URL to get to the actual edit page. Let me navigate by changing the URL. Let me scroll up to see the top toolbar:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'long'}
[result] Scrolled up by long distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! Now I can see the full page with the toolbar. I notice there's an "Edit" button (the pencil icon) but it seems I clicked on it and it took me to the plain view. Let me look for a different edit option. I see there's a split button dropdown next to "Open in Web IDE". Let me click on the dropdown arrow next to it:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': 'Dropdown arrow button next to Open in Web IDE button'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! A dropdown appeared with two options:
1. "Open in Web IDE" - Quickly and easily edit multiple files in your project
2. "Edit" - Edit this file only

Let me click on "Edit" to edit just this file:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': 'Edit option in the dropdown menu that says Edit this file only'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! The dropdown closed and now I can see the "Edit" button is highlighted. Let me wait a moment and then click directly on the "Edit" button:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': 'Edit blue button'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see it's loading (the tab shows a loading spinner). Let me wait for the edit page to load:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'duration': 3000}
[result] Finished waiting for 3000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
EXCELLENT! Finally! I now have a proper edit page with:
- "Edit file" heading
- A "Write" tab (currently active) and "Preview" tab
- An editable text area showing the current README content
- Line numbers on the left
- Formatting toolbar
- "Commit message" field at the bottom with "Update README.md"
- "Target Branch" showing "main"
- "Commit changes" and "Cancel" buttons

Now I can edit the content! Let me click in the editor area and select all the text, then replace it:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': 'Text editor area showing line 1 with # nolan_old_fans'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! The cursor is now in the editor. Now let me select all the text and replace it with the Christopher Nolan movies:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'keys': ['control', 'a']}
[result] Keys pressed successfully
Now let me type the new content:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'content': '# nolan_old_fans\n\nMovies directed by Christopher Nolan before 2010:\n\n1. Following (1998)\n2.

[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! The content has been successfully replaced! I can see the editor now shows:

```

Movies directed by Christopher Nolan before 2010:

1. Following (1998)
2. Memento (2000)
3. Insomnia (2002)
4. Batman Begins (2005)
5. The Prestige (2006)
6. The Dark Knight (2008)
```

The commit message says "Update README.md" and the target branch is "main". Now I need to scroll down and click the "Commit changes" button to save the changes:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': 'Commit changes blue button'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the button is now loading (there's a loading spinner on it). Let me wait for the commit to complete:
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'duration': 3000}

It stars   Guy Pearce  ,   Carrie-Anne Moss  , and   Joe Pantoliano  .    Guy Pearce   stars as a man who suffers from   anterograde amnesia  —resulting in   short-term memory loss   and the inability to form new memories—who uses notes and tattoos to hunt down the person who he thinks killed his wife, which is the last thing he remembers.        Carrie-Anne Moss   and   Joe Pantoliano   co-star.      The film\'s events unfold in two separate, alternating narratives—one in   color  , and the other in   black-and-white  . Leonard\'s investigation is depicted in   color   sequences that are shown in reverse chronological order (i.e., in each scene the action precedes the previous scene). The black-and-white sequences begin at the beginning of the story and move forward in time, showing Leonard conversing with an anonymous caller in a motel room.    The limited edition DVD also contains a feature that allows the film to be viewed in chronological order.    The film was acclaimed by critics, who praised its   nonlinear   narrative structure and motifs of memory, perception, grief, and   self-deception  . The film received numerous accolades, including   Academy Award   nominations for   Best Original Screenplay   and   Best Film Editing  . The film was successful at the box office, earning over US$40 million worldwide.    Reception       Box office      Memento   premiered on September 5, 2000, at the   Venice International Film Festival   and was released in European theaters starting in October.     The U.S. limited release was March 16, 2001. The film was later re-released in a limited edition DVD that features an audio commentary by Christopher Nolan, with some editions also featuring an option to watch the film in chronological order.    The original version released in theaters runs for 113 minutes in length, but the DVD release added a chronologically played version clocking in at 117 minutes. The DVD release earned over US$25 million in video sales.    Critical response     The film has an approval rating of 93% based on 270 reviews, with an average rating of 8.3/10 on   Rotten Tomatoes  . The website\'s critics consensus reads, "A taut   psychological thriller  , Memento is an inventive, entertaining, and cerebral film experience."  On   Metacritic  , the film has a weighted average score of 80 out of 100 based on 36 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".

I\'m back at the repository page. The GitLab Web IDE seems to have issues with direct text editing. Let me try a different approach - I\'ll create a new README file locally and upload it. But actually, I realize there\'s a simpler way. Let me use the "+" button next to the branch name to add/edit files directly. Let me click on the "+" button:\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502\', \'target\': \'Plus button with dropdown next to nolan_old_fans branch name\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect! A dropdown menu appeared with options. I can see "Upload file" option. Let me think of another approach - since the Web IDE has issues, I should use the local file system approach. Let me close this menu first and try creating a temporary README file locally, then upload it. Let me press Escape:\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {\'boxId\': \'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502\', \'keys\': [\'escape\']}\n[result] Keys pressed successfully\nActually, let me think of this differently. The task says to create a repo with movies in a README file. The repo "nolan_old_fans" has been successfully created. Now I just need to update the README. Since the Web IDE keeps triggering search, let me try using the local CLI to create the file and push it via git. But wait - the instructions say the CLI cannot modify files. \n\nLet me try one more time with the Web IDE, but this time I\'ll be more careful. Let me click on the README.md file link to open the IDE again:\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502\', \'target\': \'README.md filename link in the file list table\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nLoading. Let me wait:\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {\'boxId\': \'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502\', \'duration\': 3000}\n[result] Finished waiting for 3000ms. {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood! Now I see the README file view page with Edit, Replace, and Delete options. I notice there\'s a pencil icon button (edit button) next to the filename. Let me try clicking that pencil/edit icon:\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502\', \'target\': \'Pencil edit icon button to the left of the Open in Web IDE button\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nExcellent! Now I can see the file in a simple editor view with line numbers! The URL changed to include `?plain=1` which indicates this is a plain text editor. I can see the current content of the README file. Now let me scroll down to see if there\'s an edit area or I need to click somewhere:\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502\', \'direction\': \'down\', \'distance\': \'long\'}\n[result] Scrolled down by long distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI can see more of the README content. This appears to be a read-only view. Let me scroll down more to see if there are edit controls at the bottom:\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502\', \'direction\': \'down\', \'distance\': \'long\'}\n[result] Scrolled down by long distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI can see this is a read-only view showing the raw markdown. Let me scroll back up and look for an actual edit button or try clicking in the text area itself:\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502\', \'direction\': \'up\', \'distance\': \'long\'}\n[result] Scrolled up by long distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI can see this is still a read-only view. Let me try clicking directly on one of the text lines to see if it becomes editable:\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502\', \'target\': \'The text on line 7 that says To make it easy for you to get started with GitLab\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nThis appears to be a plain read-only view. The `?plain=1` parameter shows the raw content but doesn\'t allow editing. Let me remove that parameter from the URL to get to the actual edit page. Let me navigate by changing the URL. Let me scroll up to see the top toolbar:\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502\', \'direction\': \'up\', \'distance\': \'long\'}\n[result] Scrolled up by long distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood! Now I can see the full page with the toolbar. I notice there\'s an "Edit" button (the pencil icon) but it seems I clicked on it and it took me to the plain view. Let me look for a different edit option. I see there\'s a split button dropdown next to "Open in Web IDE". Let me click on the dropdown arrow next to it:\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502\', \'target\': \'Dropdown arrow button next to Open in Web IDE button\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect! A dropdown appeared with two options:\n1. "Open in Web IDE" - Quickly and easily edit multiple files in your project\n2. "Edit" - Edit this file only\n\nLet me click on "Edit" to edit just this file:\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502\', \'target\': \'Edit option in the dropdown menu that says Edit this file only\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood! The dropdown closed and now I can see the "Edit" button is highlighted. Let me wait a moment and then click directly on the "Edit" button:\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502\', \'target\': \'Edit blue button\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI can see it\'s loading (the tab shows a loading spinner). Let me wait for the edit page to load:\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {\'boxId\': \'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502\', \'duration\': 3000}\n[result] Finished waiting for 3000ms. {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nEXCELLENT! Finally! I now have a proper edit page with:\n- "Edit file" heading\n- A "Write" tab (currently active) and "Preview" tab\n- An editable text area showing the current README content\n- Line numbers on the left\n- Formatting toolbar\n- "Commit message" field at the bottom with "Update README.md"\n- "Target Branch" showing "main"\n- "Commit changes" and "Cancel" buttons\n\nNow I can edit the content! Let me click in the editor area and select all the text, then replace it:\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502\', \'target\': \'Text editor area showing line 1 with # nolan_old_fans\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood! The cursor is now in the editor. Now let me select all the text and replace it with the Christopher Nolan movies:\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {\'boxId\': \'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502\', \'keys\': [\'control\', \'a\']}\n[result] Keys pressed successfully\nNow let me type the new content:\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {\'boxId\': \'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502\', \'content\': \'# nolan_old_fans\\n\\nMovies directed by Christopher Nolan before 2010:\\n\\n1.

The content has been successfully replaced! I can see the editor now shows:\n\n```\n# nolan_old_fans\n\nMovies directed by Christopher Nolan before 2010:\n\n1. Following (1998)\n2. Memento (2000)\n3.

Now I need to scroll down and click the "Commit changes" button to save the changes:\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502\', \'target\': \'Commit changes blue button\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI can see the button is now loading (there\'s a loading spinner on it). Let me wait for the commit to complete:\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {\'boxId\': \'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502\', \'duration\': 3000}\n[result] Finished waiting for 3000ms. {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPERFECT!
