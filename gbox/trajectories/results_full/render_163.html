Good! I can see the product page is loaded and I'm on the "Details" tab. I can see there's a "Reviews (12)" tab right next to it. Let me click on the Reviews tab to view the customer reviews where I can find the criticisms.

Excellent! Now I can see the Customer Reviews section. I can already see some reviews, and I notice there are some criticisms mentioned. Let me scroll down to see all the reviews and extract the main criticisms.

From what I can see so far:
1. One review mentions: "The memory card that came is indeed a real Sony memory card. I ordered the 16gb but I only got 14 gigs even though I formatted the card. The memory card is kind of slow on games and downloads."
2. Another mentions: "No original packaging, but does come in plastic case."

Let me scroll down to see more reviews.

Good! I can see more reviews. I've found more criticisms:

3. "Though not shown in the picture, this is an actual PS VITA memory card.It's used and the previous owners data has not been erased...This isn't a problem, just reformat it."

4. "so this is a normal PS Vita card, they have used photoshop or something to remove the branding from the image. The product is a legit sony hardware that have been owned by someone else before."

5. "Genuine Vita card. Not sure where or how these guys get them, but it's real and has no issues so far. Pretty sure it's refurbished or returned, since I also had to delete some info off of it when I got it."

Let me continue scrolling to see if there are more reviews.
