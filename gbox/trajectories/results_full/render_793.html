      "favicon": "chrome://new-tab-page/favicon.ico",
      "active": true,
      "loading": false
I can see there are 2 tabs open - one CDP URL page and one "One Stop Market" page. Let me switch to the One Stop Market tab and take a screenshot to see what's on the page.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__switch_tab: {'boxId': 'def8426c-3556-4dc9-be78-05f463ca6f95', 'tabId': '2'}
[result] Switched to tab 2 successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I'm on the One Stop Market website. I can see the homepage with various product categories in the navigation menu. I need to:
1. Navigate to "Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry" category
2. Find the "Men" clothing subcategory
3. Filter by price between $50 and $129.99
4. Find the highest rated product
5. Purchase it

Let me click on "Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry" in the navigation menu.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'def8426c-3556-4dc9-be78-05f463ca6f95', 'target': 'Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry link in the main navigation menu'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! A dropdown menu has appeared showing subcategories:
- Men
- Women
- Novelty & More
- Sport Specific Clothing

I need to click on "Men" to access the Men's clothing category.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'def8426c-3556-4dc9-be78-05f463ca6f95', 'target': 'Men link in the dropdown menu under Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! I'm now on the Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry page. I can see:

**Left sidebar with filters:**
- Category: Men (7648), Women (9769), Novelty & More (3143), Sport Specific Clothing (265)
- Price ranges available including $0.00 - $99.99, $100.00 - $199.99, etc.

**Current products showing:**
- Items 1-12 of 20923 total items
- I can see some products but I need to filter by Men category first and then by the price range ($50 - $129.99)

Let me click on "Men (7648)" to filter by Men's clothing.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'def8426c-3556-4dc9-be78-05f463ca6f95', 'target': 'Men (7648) link in the Category section of Shopping Options'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I'm viewing Men's clothing only (Items 1-12 of 7648). I can see:

**"Now Shopping by"** section shows:
- Category: Men (with Remove This Item link)

**Shopping Options** shows:
- Category: Clothing (4561), Shoes (2523), Uniforms, Work & Safety (416)
- Price ranges including the one I need: $0.00 - $99.99 (6798)

I need to filter by price range **above $50 but under $129.99**. Looking at the price options, I need to select the range that fits. I can see:
- $0.00 - $99.99 (6798)
- $100.00 - $199.99 (654)

However, I need "above 50 but under 129.99", which spans across these ranges. Let me scroll down to see if there are more specific price filters.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'def8426c-3556-4dc9-be78-05f463ca6f95', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'short'}
[result] Scrolled down by short distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see more products now. I notice there are various price points, but I need to apply the price filter. Let me scroll back up to see the price filter options in the sidebar.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'def8426c-3556-4dc9-be78-05f463ca6f95', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'short'}
[result] Scrolled up by short distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! Now I can see the price filters clearly:
- $0.00 - $99.99 (6798)
- $100.00 - $199.99 (654)
- $200.00 - $299.99 (127)
- $300.00 - $399.99 (39)
- $400.00 - $499.99 (11)
- $500.00 - $599.99 (8)
- $600.00 - $699.99 (5)
- $700.00 - $799.99 (4)
- $800.00 - $899.99 (1)
- $900.00 and above (1)

The task requires products "above 50 but under 129.99". This price range spans across two filter categories:
- Some products in $0.00 - $99.99 range (those between $50-$99.99)
- Some products in $100.00 - $199.99 range (those between $100-$129.99)

Since I can't select multiple price ranges at once with these filters, let me use the "Advanced Search" feature instead, which might allow me to specify exact price ranges. Let me click on "Advanced Search".
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'def8426c-3556-4dc9-be78-05f463ca6f95', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled up by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the Advanced Search link in the top right. Let me click on it to access more precise price filtering options.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'def8426c-3556-4dc9-be78-05f463ca6f95', 'target': 'Advanced Search link in the top right area near the search box'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I notice the URL changed to the advanced search page, but I'm still seeing the same view. Let me wait a moment for the page to fully load, then take another screenshot.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'def8426c-3556-4dc9-be78-05f463ca6f95', 'duration': 1000}
[result] Finished waiting for 1000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I'm on the Advanced Search page. I can see:

**Search Settings:**
- Product Name
- SKU
- Description
- Short Description
- **Price** (with two input fields for price range and "USD")
- Search button

This is exactly what I need! I can set the price range. However, I need to scroll down to see if there are more fields like category selection. Let me scroll down first.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'def8426c-3556-4dc9-be78-05f463ca6f95', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'short'}
[result] Scrolled down by short distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the advanced search form doesn't have a category selector visible. Let me go back to the Men's clothing page and use a different approach. I'll apply the price filters manually and sort by rating to find the highest rated product. Let me navigate back.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'def8426c-3556-4dc9-be78-05f463ca6f95', 'target': 'Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry link in the navigation menu'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Great! The dropdown menu appeared again. Actually, I can use this Advanced Search form effectively. Let me:
1. Enter the price range (50.01 to 129.99)
2. Then click Search
3. After getting results, I'll navigate to Men category

Let me scroll up to see the price fields clearly and fill them in.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'def8426c-3556-4dc9-be78-05f463ca6f95', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'short'}
[result] Scrolled up by short distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good, I'm back at the main Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry page. I can see the category filters on the left. Let me click on "Men (7648)" first to filter by Men's clothing.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'def8426c-3556-4dc9-be78-05f463ca6f95', 'target': 'Men (7648) link in the Category section'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I see the URL has changed to include "?cat=26", but the page looks the same. Let me wait a moment and then take a screenshot to see if it has updated.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'def8426c-3556-4dc9-be78-05f463ca6f95', 'duration': 1500}
[result] Finished waiting for 1500ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I can see the page has updated and shows:
- **"Now Shopping by"** - Category: Men (with Remove This Item link)
- Items 1-12 of 7648 (Men's items only)

Now I need to apply the price filter. I need products "above 50 but under 129.99". Looking at the price filters on the left:
- $0.00 - $99.99 (6798) - includes items from $50-$99.99 that I need
- $100.00 - $199.99 (654) - includes items from $100-$129.99 that I need

Since I can't select both ranges at once with these preset filters, let me try clicking on "$100.00 - $199.99" first to see the products in that range, then I can manually look through both ranges. But actually, a better approach is to sort by rating first within each price range.

Let me start by clicking the $100.00 - $199.99 price range to see highly-rated products in that range.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'def8426c-3556-4dc9-be78-05f463ca6f95', 'target': '$100.00 - $199.99 (654) link in the Price section'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the URL has changed to include price filter parameters. Let me wait for the page to fully load and display the filtered results.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'def8426c-3556-4dc9-be78-05f463ca6f95', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! The page has now filtered to show items in the $100-$199.99 price range. I can see:
- **Items 1-12 of 654**
- **Now Shopping by:** Category: Men, Price: $100.00 - $199.99

I can see products but many are above my budget of $129.99:
- HAFLINGER Men's Wool Felt Open Back Slippers - $108.00 (with 5 stars, 2 Reviews)
- Klogs Footwear Hadley Black/White 9.5 M (C) - $124.95
- Wornstar Clothing Nightfall Pants - $169.00 (too expensive)
- Merrell Men's Jungle Moc Leather Slip-On - $109.04

I need to look at more specific price ranges. Let me check the refined Price filters on the left. I can see:
- $100.00 - $109.99 (116)
- $110.00 - $119.99 (103)
- $120.00 - $129.99 (91) 

Let me click on $120.00 - $129.99 to see items in that range, then I'll also need to check the $50-99.99 range to compare ratings.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'def8426c-3556-4dc9-be78-05f463ca6f95', 'target': '$120.00 - $129.99 (91) link in the Price section'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the URL changed but the page is still showing the same 654 items. Let me wait for it to update and then take a screenshot.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'def8426c-3556-4dc9-be78-05f463ca6f95', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! Now I can see the filtered results:
- **Items 1-12 of 91** (items in the $120-$129.99 range)
- **Now Shopping by:** Category: Men, Price: $120.00 - $129.99

Products showing:
1. Klogs Footwear Hadley Black/White 9.5 M (C) - $124.95
2. Reebok Men Athletics Shoes Running Training Walking Ridgerider 6 Gore-Tex FW9642 New - $123.95
3. GUESS Olinia Black/Grey 6 M - $126.98
4. Wrangler 6" Work Rugged Wedge Boot - Safety Toe Boots with Round Toe Profile, Blown Rubber Wedge Soles, Waterproof Lining, and Blend85™ Upcycled Footbeds - $129.95

I can see products, but I notice none of them are showing star ratings on this page. I need to sort by rating or look for products with reviews. Let me change the "Sort By" dropdown to sort by rating. Let me click on the "Sort By" dropdown.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'def8426c-3556-4dc9-be78-05f463ca6f95', 'target': 'Position dropdown menu in the Sort By section at the top right'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! The dropdown menu is now open showing:
- Position (currently selected)
- Product Name
- Price

I don't see a "Rating" or "Reviews" option in this dropdown. Let me try a different approach. I'll need to manually browse through the products and check their ratings. Let me scroll down to see more products and their ratings on this page.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'def8426c-3556-4dc9-be78-05f463ca6f95', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Great! Now I can see products with ratings. I found one with reviews:

**Vittoria Alise' Performance Road Cycling Shoes** - $129.99 - ⭐⭐⭐⭐½ (4.5 stars) - 5 Reviews

Other products visible:
- UGG Men's Pismo Sneaker Low, Bone White, 8.5 - $129.95 (no rating shown)
- Geox Women's D Wimbley C Loafers, Black Black C9999, 7.5 - $122.49 (no rating shown)
- PUMA Select Men's x Daily Paper Match Splatter Sneakers - $120.00 (no rating shown)

The Vittoria Alise' Performance Road Cycling Shoes at $129.99 has 4.5 stars with 5 reviews, which is good. However, I need to check if there are products with even higher ratings. Let me continue scrolling to see more products in this price range.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'def8426c-3556-4dc9-be78-05f463ca6f95', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! I found more products with ratings in the $120-$129.99 range:

1. **Nike Men's Reax 8 TR Mesh Fashion Sneaker Shoes** - $124.57 - ⭐⭐⭐ (3 stars) - 2 Reviews
2. **Reebok Work Men's Astroride Steel Toe Athleti Black and Dark Grey** - $124.72 - (no rating shown)
3. **Dunross & Sons Men's Fashion Sneaker. Clean and Casual Leather Low Top Crafted with Premium Genuine Leather and Ortholite Removable Insole for All-Day Comfort.** - $128.00 - ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4 stars) - 49 Reviews
4. **Panama Jack Men's Fisherman Sandal, Marino C6, 11** - $128.54 - (no rating shown)

I can see pagination at the bottom (1 2 3 4 5). So far, the best rated product I've found in the $120-$129.99 range is:
- **Vittoria Alise' Performance Road Cycling Shoes** - $129.99 - 4.5 stars - 5 Reviews

However, I also found:
- **Dunross & Sons Men's Fashion Sneaker** - $128.00 - 4 stars - **49 Reviews**

The Dunross & Sons has many more reviews (49) which makes it more reliable, even though it's 4 stars vs 4.5 stars. But I need to check the lower price ranges too ($50-$119.99) to make sure I'm getting the highest rated product overall. Let me remove the current price filter and check other price ranges. Let me scroll up to access the filters.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'def8426c-3556-4dc9-be78-05f463ca6f95', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'long'}
[result] Scrolled up by long distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good, I can see the Vittoria Alise' Performance Road Cycling Shoes again with 4.5 stars and 5 reviews at $129.99. Now I need to check the other price ranges ($50-$119.99) to ensure I'm not missing a higher-rated product. Let me scroll up more to see the filter options.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'def8426c-3556-4dc9-be78-05f463ca6f95', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'long'}
[result] Scrolled up by long distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I can see the filters on the left. I can see "Remove This Item" link next to the price filter. Let me click on "Remove This Item" to remove the $120-$129.99 filter, then I'll check the other price ranges.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'def8426c-3556-4dc9-be78-05f463ca6f95', 'target': 'Remove This Item link next to $120.00 - $129.99 in the Price section under Now Shopping by'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I notice the page hasn't updated yet. Let me wait for it to reload.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'def8426c-3556-4dc9-be78-05f463ca6f95', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The page still shows the same items and the URL still has the price filter. Let me try using the browser's back button to go back to the full Men's category view. Let me use the keyboard shortcut to go back.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': 'def8426c-3556-4dc9-be78-05f463ca6f95', 'keys': ['alt', 'arrowLeft']}

Good! I went back to the $100-$199.99 range (Items 1-12 of 654). I can see the HAFLINGER Men's Wool Felt Open Back Slippers with 5 stars and 2 Reviews at $108.00. 

Now let me check the lower price ranges. I need to look at products between $50-$99.99. Let me scroll down to see the price filter options.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'def8426c-3556-4dc9-be78-05f463ca6f95', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'short'}
[result] Scrolled down by short distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I can see more products:
- **Reyn Spooner Deep Sea Jive Hawaiian Aloha Shirt** - $108.00 - ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5 stars) - 3 Reviews

Looking at the price options, I need to select the range that fits. I can see:\n- $0.00 - $99.99 (6798)\n- $100.00 - $199.99 (654)\n\nHowever, I need "above 50 but under 129.99", which spans across these ranges.

This price range spans across two filter categories:\n- Some products in $0.00 - $99.99 range (those between $50-$99.99)\n- Some products in $100.00 - $199.99 range (those between $100-$129.99)\n\nSince I can\'t select multiple price ranges at once with these filters, let me use the "Advanced Search" feature instead, which might allow me to specify exact price ranges.
