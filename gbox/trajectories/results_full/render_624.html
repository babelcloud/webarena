I can see there are two tabs open. Tab 2 has "Postmill" which appears to be the Reddit-like test website. Let me switch to that tab and take a screenshot.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__switch_tab: {'boxId': 'def8426c-3556-4dc9-be78-05f463ca6f95', 'tabId': '2'}
[result] Switched to tab 2 successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I'm now on Postmill (a Reddit-like test website). I can see:
- I'm logged in as "MarvelsGrantMan136"
- There's a "Forums" link in the navigation
- The message says "You are not subscribed to any forum. Showing featured forums instead."

I need to find a subreddit for relationships/relations. Let me click on "Forums" to see what forums are available.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'def8426c-3556-4dc9-be78-05f463ca6f95', 'target': 'Forums link in the top navigation bar'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I see the URL changed to /forums but the page still shows the same view. Let me wait a moment for the page to fully load and then take another screenshot.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'def8426c-3556-4dc9-be78-05f463ca6f95', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I can now see the list of forums. I found exactly what I need:

**"/r/relationship_advice"** - This is the subreddit for relationship advice, which is perfect for asking about break-up remedies.

Let me click on this forum to enter it.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'def8426c-3556-4dc9-be78-05f463ca6f95', 'target': '/r/relationship_advice link'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the URL changed to /r/relationship_advice but the page is still showing the forums list. Let me wait a moment and then take another screenshot to see if the page loads.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'def8426c-3556-4dc9-be78-05f463ca6f95', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I'm now in the /r/relationship_advice subreddit. I can see various relationship-related posts. Now I need to create a post asking for advice about break-up remedy. I can see there's a "+ Submit" button in the top navigation bar. Let me click on that to create a new post.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'def8426c-3556-4dc9-be78-05f463ca6f95', 'target': '+ Submit button in the top navigation bar'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the URL changed to /submit/relationship_advice but the page hasn't loaded yet. Let me wait a moment and take another screenshot to see the submission form.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'def8426c-3556-4dc9-be78-05f463ca6f95', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! I can now see the submission form. I have:
- URL field (optional)
- Title field (required - marked with *)
- Body field
- Forum dropdown (already set to "relationship_advice")
- "Create submission" button

Now I'll fill out the form to ask for advice about break-up remedy. Let me start by clicking on the Title field and entering a title.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'def8426c-3556-4dc9-be78-05f463ca6f95', 'target': 'Title text input field'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! The title field is now focused (I can see it has a red border). Now I'll type a title asking for break-up advice.

[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! The title has been entered: "Need advice on how to heal after a difficult break-up". Now I need to click on the Body field and add some details about the break-up situation.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'def8426c-3556-4dc9-be78-05f463ca6f95', 'target': 'Body text area field'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! The Body field is now focused (I can see the red border). Now I'll type the body of the post asking for break-up advice.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {'boxId': 'def8426c-3556-4dc9-be78-05f463ca6f95', 'content': "I recently went through a tough break-up and I'm struggling to move on.

I can see the URL has changed to include the post slug "/r/relationship_advice/6/need-advice-on-how-to-heal-after-a-difficult-break-up", and there's now a "Preview" section showing how the post will look. The page is showing the form still, which means I need to scroll down or wait for it to fully process. Let me wait a moment and then take a screenshot to see if the post was successfully created.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'def8426c-3556-4dc9-be78-05f463ca6f95', 'duration': 2000}
