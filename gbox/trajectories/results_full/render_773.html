I can see I'm currently on the Magento Admin Dashboard. To delete pending negative reviews, I need to navigate to the reviews section. Let me look for the Marketing section in the left sidebar, as reviews are typically managed there.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'MARKETING menu item in the left sidebar'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! The Marketing menu has expanded and I can see there's a "Pending Reviews" option under "User Content". Let me click on it to see the pending reviews.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'Pending Reviews link under User Content section'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the URL has changed to the pending reviews page. The menu is still open, let me close it first to see the content better.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'X close button on the Marketing menu panel'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! Now I can see the pending reviews table. I can see there are at least 2 pending reviews visible. Let me close the Marketing menu to get a better view of all the reviews.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'keys': ['escape']}

Perfect! Now I can see the Pending Reviews page clearly. I can see there are "2 records found" and I can see 2 reviews:

1. ID 351 - Title: "won't recommand" by Emma - Review: "I was really disappointed with the Oliva 1/4 z..."
2. ID 349 - Title: "OKish" by seam miller - Review: "I have to say, I'm not impressed with the Oliv..."

Both appear to be negative reviews based on the titles and preview text. Now I need to check if there are any more reviews by scrolling or checking if there are more pages. I can see it says "1 of 1" at the bottom, so these are all the pending reviews.

To delete these negative reviews, I need to first identify which ones are actually negative. Let me click on each review to see the full content and rating to confirm they are negative. Let me start with the first one.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'Edit link in the Action column for the first review with ID 351'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the URL changed to edit/id/351, indicating the page is loading. Let me wait a moment for it to load completely.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I can now see the full review details for the first review:

- **Summary Rating**: 2 stars (out of 5) - This is clearly a negative review
- **Detailed Rating**: 1 star
- **Status**: Pending
- **Summary of Review**: "won't recommand"
- **Full Review**: "I was really disappointed with the Olivia 1/4 Zip Light Jacket. The material is extremely thin and flimsy, which makes it not very warm at all. I was hoping for something that would keep me comfortable in the springtime, but this jacket just doesn't cut it. Additionally, the sizing is way off - I ordered my usual size and it was way too tight in the arms and shoulders. I had to return it and won't be buying from this brand again."

This is definitely a negative review (2 stars). I can see there's a "Delete Review" button at the top. Let me click it to delete this review.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'Delete Review button in the top action bar'}

Great! A confirmation dialog has appeared asking "Are you sure you want to do this?" I need to click "OK" to confirm the deletion.

Excellent! The first review has been successfully deleted. I can see the success message "The review has been deleted." at the top of the page. Now I'm on the "All Reviews" page showing "349 records found", and I can see review ID 349 is still listed with status "Pending". This is the second negative review I need to delete.

Now I need to check if this review (ID 349) is indeed negative, then delete it. Let me click on the "Pending" status filter or navigate back to the Pending Reviews page to see only pending reviews.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'Edit link in the Action column for review ID 349'}

Perfect! I can now see the details of the second review (ID 349):

- **Summary Rating**: 3 stars (out of 5)
- **Detailed Rating**: 3 stars
- **Status**: Pending
- **Summary of Review**: "OKish"
- **Full Review**: "I have to say, I'm not impressed with the Olivia 1/4 Zip Light Jacket. The color is not as vibrant as it looked online, and the zipper is really hard to use. The jacket is also not very breathable, so I found myself getting really sweaty when I wore it for even a short amount of time. Finally, the pockets are really shallow and not very functional. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this jacket - there are better options out there for the price."

This review has a 3-star rating. While it's not a glowing review and contains criticism, a 3-star rating is typically considered "neutral" or "mixed" rather than strictly negative. However, the content is clearly negative ("I'm not impressed", "I wouldn't recommend"). 

Typically, "negative reviews" are defined as reviews with ratings below a certain threshold (usually 3 stars or below, sometimes only 1-2 stars). Since the task is to delete "all pending negative reviews," I need to determine if 3-star reviews count as negative. Given the negative language in the review content and that 3 stars is typically the borderline, I'll delete this one as well to be thorough.

Excellent! The second review has been successfully deleted as well. I can see the success message "The review has been deleted." and the total records count has decreased from 349 to 348 records.

Now I need to verify that there are no more pending negative reviews. Let me navigate back to the Pending Reviews page to check if there are any remaining pending reviews.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'MARKETING menu item in the left sidebar'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good, the Marketing menu is open. Now let me click on "Pending Reviews" to check if there are any remaining pending reviews.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'Pending Reviews link under User Content section'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I have successfully completed the task. The Pending Reviews page now shows:

- **"0 records found"**
- **"We couldn't find any records."**

This confirms that all pending reviews have been deleted. I successfully deleted both pending negative reviews:

1. **Review ID 351** - 2-star review by Emma with title "won't recommand" - complained about the Olivia 1/4 Zip Light Jacket being thin, flimsy, not warm, and having sizing issues.

2. **Review ID 349** - 3-star review by seam miller with title "OKish" - stated they were not impressed with the Olivia 1/4 Zip Light Jacket, wouldn't recommend it, and had issues with color, zipper, breathability, and pockets.

There are now no pending reviews remaining in the system, which means all pending negative reviews have been successfully deleted.

The jacket is also not very breathable, so I found myself getting really sweaty when I wore it for even a short amount of time. Finally, the pockets are really shallow and not very functional. Overall, I wouldn\'t recommend this jacket - there are better options out there for the price."\n\nThis review has a 3-star rating. While it\'s not a glowing review and contains criticism, a 3-star rating is typically considered "neutral" or "mixed" rather than strictly negative. However, the content is clearly negative ("I\'m not impressed", "I wouldn\'t recommend"). \n\nTypically, "negative reviews" are defined as reviews with ratings below a certain threshold (usually 3 stars or below, sometimes only 1-2 stars). Since the task is to delete "all pending negative reviews," I need to determine if 3-star reviews count as negative. Given the negative language in the review content and that 3 stars is typically the borderline, I\'ll delete this one as well to be thorough.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c\', \'target\': \'Delete Review button in the top action bar\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood!

The second review has been successfully deleted as well. I can see the success message "The review has been deleted." and the total records count has decreased from 349 to 348 records.\n\nNow I need to verify that there are no more pending negative reviews. Let me navigate back to the Pending Reviews page to check if there are any remaining pending reviews.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c\', \'target\': \'MARKETING menu item in the left sidebar\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood, the Marketing menu is open.

I have successfully completed the task. The Pending Reviews page now shows:\n\n- **"0 records found"**\n- **"We couldn\'t find any records."**\n\nThis confirms that all pending reviews have been deleted. I successfully deleted both pending negative reviews:\n\n1. **Review ID 351** - 2-star review by Emma with title "won\'t recommand" - complained about the Olivia 1/4 Zip Light Jacket being thin, flimsy, not warm, and having sizing issues.\n\n2. **Review ID 349** - 3-star review by seam miller with title "OKish" - stated they were not impressed with the Olivia 1/4 Zip Light Jacket, wouldn\'t recommend it, and had issues with color, zipper, breathability, and pockets.\n\nThere are now no pending reviews remaining in the system, which means all pending negative reviews have been successfully deleted.\n[tool] mcp__task-completion__complete_task: {\'finalAnswer\': \'All pending negative reviews have been successfully deleted.
