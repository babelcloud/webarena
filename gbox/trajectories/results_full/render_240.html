Good! I can see the One Stop Market website is already open. Now I need to navigate to the "Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry" category to find the competitive swimwear section. Let me click on that category.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry navigation menu item'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! A dropdown menu appeared with several options. I can see "Sport Specific Clothing" which should contain competitive swimwear. Let me click on that option.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Sport Specific Clothing menu option in the dropdown'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I'm now on the Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry page. I can see there's a "Sport Specific Clothing" category on the left sidebar with 265 items. Let me click on that to access the sport-specific clothing section where competitive swimwear should be.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Sport Specific Clothing category link showing 265 items in the left sidebar'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I can now see the Sport Specific Clothing section is filtered, and importantly, I can see "Competitive Swimwear (55)" in the Shopping Options on the left sidebar. Let me click on that to specifically access the competitive swimwear category.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Competitive Swimwear link showing 55 items in the left sidebar'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I notice the page hasn't changed much - it still shows 265 items. Let me scroll down to see if there are more specific subcategories or if the page is loading the competitive swimwear items.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Great! Now I can see swimwear products. However, I need to filter specifically for competitive swimwear and find the most expensive one. Instead of scrolling through all items, let me use a more efficient approach. I'll sort by price (highest to lowest) to quickly find the most expensive product. Let me scroll back up to access the sort dropdown.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled up by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I can see the page is filtered to show only "Competitive Swimwear" category (55 items shown in "Items 1-12 of 55"). I can see the "Sort By" dropdown is set to "Position". Let me click on it to sort by price (highest to lowest) to find the most expensive product quickly.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Sort By dropdown menu showing Position'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Great! The dropdown menu is now open showing three options: Position, Product Name, and Price. Let me click on "Price" to sort by price.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Price option in the sort dropdown menu'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! The sort is now set to "Price". However, I need to check if it's sorting from lowest to highest or highest to lowest. Looking at the current visible prices: $16.92, $9.54, $20.18, and $6.99, it seems like it might be sorting by lowest to highest. I need to click on the arrow next to the dropdown to change the sort order to descending (highest to lowest). Let me click on the up arrow to change the sort direction.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Sort direction arrow button next to the Price dropdown'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the page has reloaded and is now showing products sorted by price. However, looking at the prices shown ($0.29, $2.29, $3.48, $3.99), these appear to be sorted from lowest to highest. I can also see there's a "$60.00 and above (1)" price filter option on the left sidebar, which suggests there's at least one product priced at $60 or more. Let me click on that filter to find the most expensive product.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': '$60.00 and above price filter link showing 1 item in the left sidebar'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the page is now showing products with visible prices. Looking at the current items: $64.26, $48.53, $45.34, and $38.91. The "$60.00 and above (1)" filter in the sidebar suggests there might be more expensive items. Let me scroll down to see all products in this price range or I should check if the sort is now descending. Let me click on the sort arrow again to ensure it's sorting from highest to lowest price.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Sort direction arrow button next to the Price dropdown'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I can see that the page is filtered to show only items in the $60.00 - $69.99 price range, and there's "1 Item" shown. The product displayed is:

**Women Cross Flower Beachwear Tankini Bandeau Bandage Bikini Set Push-Up Swimwear Bathing Suit Two Pieces Swimsuits**
**Price: $64.26**

This appears to be the most expensive product in the competitive swimwear category. However, let me remove this price filter to verify there are no products priced higher than $69.99. Let me click "Remove This Item" to clear the price filter.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Remove This Item link next to the price filter in the Now Shopping by section'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The page still shows the same result. Let me scroll down to see if there are more items or let me check the price filter options on the left sidebar to understand the full price range. Let me scroll down first.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled up by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I notice the page now shows "3 Items" instead of "1 Item", and I can see it's filtered by "Sport Specific Clothing" and price "$60.00 - $69.99". Looking at the visible products:
1. Women Cross Flower Beachwear - $64.26
2. Men's Suit Jacket - $64.66
3. ADDHEAT Winter Heated Hoodies - $69.98

However, I can see in the Shopping Options that "Competitive Swimwear (1)" is shown, which means only 1 of these 3 items is actually in the competitive swimwear category. Let me click on the "Competitive Swimwear" filter to show only competitive swimwear items.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Competitive Swimwear category link showing 1 item in the Shopping Options section'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The page still shows "3 Items". Let me try a different approach. Let me clear all filters first and then apply only the Competitive Swimwear category filter to see all items in that category sorted by price. Let me click "Clear All".
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Clear All link below the Remove This Item link in the Now Shopping by section'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! Now the page shows "1 Item" and the filters show:
- Category: Competitive Swimwear
- Price: $60.00 - $69.99

This confirms that there is only 1 item in the Competitive Swimwear category within the $60-$69.99 price range. Now let me remove the price filter to see all competitive swimwear items and verify this is indeed the most expensive one.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Remove This Item link next to the price range $60.00 - $69.99'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I see the page now shows "Items 1-12 of 20923" which means the Competitive Swimwear filter was removed. Let me apply the Competitive Swimwear filter again by clicking on "Sport Specific Clothing" to access the subcategories.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Sport Specific Clothing link showing 265 items in the left sidebar'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I see a dropdown menu appeared when I clicked on Sports & Outdoors. I can see several options but I need to navigate back to the Clothing section. Let me click away from this dropdown and try a different approach. Let me scroll down to see if there are subcategory options in the sidebar.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'keys': ['escape']}
[result] Keys pressed successfully
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86'}
[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I accidentally navigated to the Sports & Outdoors page. I need to go back to Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry and then navigate to the Competitive Swimwear category. Let me click on "Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry".
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry navigation menu item'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! The dropdown menu is showing. Let me click on "Sport Specific Clothing" to access that category.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Sport Specific Clothing option in the dropdown menu'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The page appears to be loading. Let me wait a moment and then take another screenshot to see the content.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I'm back on the Sport Specific Clothing page showing 265 items. I can see "Competitive Swimwear (55)" in the Shopping Options. Now let me click on that to filter only competitive swimwear items, and then I'll sort by price to find the most expensive one.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Competitive Swimwear link showing 55 items in the Shopping Options Category section'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I'm on the Competitive Swimwear category page showing "Items 1-12 of 55". I can see it's sorted by "Position". Now let me sort by Price to find the most expensive item. Let me click on the Sort By dropdown.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Sort By dropdown showing Position in the upper right area'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! The dropdown is now open showing Position, Product Name, and Price. Let me click on "Price" to sort by price.

Good! The page is now loaded and sorted by Price. I can see "Items 1-12 of 55" and the category is filtered to "Competitive Swimwear". The current items showing prices are: $0.29, $2.29, $3.48, $3.99. These are sorted from lowest to highest. I need to change the sort direction to descending (highest to lowest) by clicking the arrow button next to the dropdown.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Sort direction arrow button next to the Price dropdown'}

I can see the URL has changed to include "product_list_dir=desc" which means it should now be sorting in descending order (highest to lowest). However, the page is still showing the same low-priced items ($0.29, $2.29, $3.48, $3.99). Let me scroll down to see if the page layout has changed or wait for it to reload.

Let me click on that to specifically access the competitive swimwear category.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'target\': \'Competitive Swimwear link showing 55 items in the left sidebar\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI notice the page hasn\'t changed much - it still shows 265 items.

Now I can see swimwear products. However, I need to filter specifically for competitive swimwear and find the most expensive one. Instead of scrolling through all items, let me use a more efficient approach. I\'ll sort by price (highest to lowest) to quickly find the most expensive product.

Let me click on it to sort by price (highest to lowest) to find the most expensive product quickly.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'target\': \'Sort By dropdown menu showing Position\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGreat!

The sort is now set to "Price". However, I need to check if it\'s sorting from lowest to highest or highest to lowest. Looking at the current visible prices: $16.92, $9.54, $20.18, and $6.99, it seems like it might be sorting by lowest to highest. I need to click on the arrow next to the dropdown to change the sort order to descending (highest to lowest). Let me click on the up arrow to change the sort direction.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'target\': \'Sort direction arrow button next to the Price dropdown\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI can see the page has reloaded and is now showing products sorted by price. However, looking at the prices shown ($0.29, $2.29, $3.48, $3.99), these appear to be sorted from lowest to highest. I can also see there\'s a "$60.00 and above (1)" price filter option on the left sidebar, which suggests there\'s at least one product priced at $60 or more. Let me click on that filter to find the most expensive product.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'target\': \'$60.00 and above price filter link showing 1 item in the left sidebar\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI can see the page is now showing products with visible prices. Looking at the current items: $64.26, $48.53, $45.34, and $38.91. The "$60.00 and above (1)" filter in the sidebar suggests there might be more expensive items. Let me scroll down to see all products in this price range or I should check if the sort is now descending.

The product displayed is:\n\n**Women Cross Flower Beachwear Tankini Bandeau Bandage Bikini Set Push-Up Swimwear Bathing Suit Two Pieces Swimsuits**\n**Price: $64.26**\n\nThis appears to be the most expensive product in the competitive swimwear category. However, let me remove this price filter to verify there are no products priced higher than $69.99. Let me click "Remove This Item" to clear the price filter.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'target\': \'Remove This Item link next to the price filter in the Now Shopping by section\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nThe page still shows the same result.

Looking at the visible products:\n1. Women Cross Flower Beachwear - $64.26\n2. Men\'s Suit Jacket - $64.66\n3. ADDHEAT Winter Heated Hoodies - $69.98\n\nHowever, I can see in the Shopping Options that "Competitive Swimwear (1)" is shown, which means only 1 of these 3 items is actually in the competitive swimwear category. Let me click on the "Competitive Swimwear" filter to show only competitive swimwear items.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'target\': \'Competitive Swimwear category link showing 1 item in the Shopping Options section\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nThe page still shows "3 Items".

Now let me remove the price filter to see all competitive swimwear items and verify this is indeed the most expensive one.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'target\': \'Remove This Item link next to the price range $60.00 - $69.99\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI see the page now shows "Items 1-12 of 20923" which means the Competitive Swimwear filter was removed.
