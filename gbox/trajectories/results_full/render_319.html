I can see I'm on the One Stop Market e-commerce website. I need to navigate to "My Account" to find the cancelled order from April 2022. Let me click on "My Account" in the top right.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'My Account link in the top right navigation bar'}

I can see the page is loading (notice the URL changed to .../customer/account/). Let me wait a moment for it to fully load and then take another screenshot.

Perfect! I can see the My Account page with Recent Orders. I can see two orders listed:
- Order #000000170 dated 5/17/23 with status "Cancelled" and Order Total $365.42
- Order #000000189 dated 5/2/23 with status "Pending" and Order Total $754.99

However, I need to find an order from April 2022, not 2023. I need to check if there are more orders. Let me click on "My Orders" in the left sidebar to see all orders.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'My Orders link in the left sidebar navigation menu'}

Excellent! I can see the My Orders page. It shows "Items 1 to 10 of 37 total" and I can see orders from 2023. The most recent orders shown are from 5/17/23, 5/2/23, 3/11/23, 3/10/23, 2/27/23, 2/24/23, 2/11/23, and 2/9/23. 

I need to find an order from April 2022, which would be much older. I can see pagination at the bottom (1, 2, 3, 4). Let me navigate to the last page to see the oldest orders. Let me click on page 4.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'pagination button labeled 4'}

I see the URL has changed to include "?p=4" but the page content hasn't updated yet. Let me wait for it to load.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'duration': 2000}

[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I can see page 4 showing "Items 31 to 37 of 37 total" with orders from 2022. I can see:

- Order #000000182 - 6/30/22 - $173.56 - Canceled
- Order #000000181 - 5/22/22 - $298.65 - Complete
- Order #000000168 - 4/27/22 - $24.86 - Complete
- Order #000000159 - 4/5/22 - $77.96 - Complete
- Order #000000173 - 3/10/22 - $206.59 - Canceled
- Order #000000160 - 3/2/22 - $115.18 - Canceled
- Order #000000169 - 3/2/22 - $52.35 - Complete

I can see there are two orders from April 2022:
1. Order #000000168 - 4/27/22 - $24.86 - Complete (NOT cancelled)
2. Order #000000159 - 4/5/22 - $77.96 - Complete (NOT cancelled)

However, these orders show status as "Complete", not "Canceled". The task asks for a cancelled order from April 2022. Let me check the other pages to see if there's a cancelled order from April 2022. Let me go to page 3.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'pagination button labeled 3'}

Good! I can see page 3 showing "Items 21 to 30 of 37 total" with orders from later in 2022 (July-October 2022). I don't see any April 2022 orders here. Let me check page 2 to see if there might be a cancelled order from April 2022 there.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'pagination button labeled 2'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I see the page hasn't updated yet. Let me wait for it to load.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'duration': 2000}

[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I notice I'm back on page 1. I've reviewed all the pages and found that the only orders from April 2022 are:
1. Order #000000168 - 4/27/22 - $24.86 - Complete
2. Order #000000159 - 4/5/22 - $77.96 - Complete

Both show status as "Complete", not "Canceled". However, the task specifically asks about an order "cancelled in April 2022". Let me re-check the wording - it could mean an order that was cancelled during April 2022, or it could be interpreted differently. Let me look more carefully at the data I've collected.

Looking back at all the pages:
- Page 4 had orders from April 2022, but they were "Complete" status
- I didn't see any "Canceled" orders from April 2022

Let me try a different approach. Perhaps the task is asking about an order placed in April 2022 that was later cancelled. Let me scroll down on this page to see if there are any filters or search options I can use to find cancelled orders specifically.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the page more clearly now. Based on my review of all the pages, I haven't found any cancelled orders specifically from April 2022. However, I notice the task wording says "order canlled" (which appears to be a typo for "cancelled"). 

Let me reconsider: perhaps the task is asking about a specific order that I should know about. Let me check if there might be more detailed information by looking at one of the April 2022 orders. Since the two April 2022 orders I found were marked as "Complete", maybe one of them was actually cancelled but the status shows differently in the order details. Let me click on the "View Order" link for order #000000159 (4/5/22).

Let me first scroll back up to see the pagination and navigate back to page 4.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled up by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I'm on page 1. Let me think about this differently. Perhaps "order cancelled in April 2022" could mean an order that was placed earlier but cancelled during April 2022. However, the cancellation date might not be visible in the order history list - I would need to check the order details.

But wait - let me reconsider the task more carefully. The task says "How much refund I should expect from my order canlled in April 2022". This suggests there IS a cancelled order from April 2022. Let me check if maybe I missed something. Let me try using the search/filter functionality if available, or let me check the "Show" dropdown to see if I can increase the items per page to view all orders at once.

Let me click on the "Show" dropdown that currently shows "10" per page.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Show dropdown menu that displays 10 per page'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! The dropdown is open showing options 10, 20, and 50. Let me select 50 to view all 37 orders on one page.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'dropdown option showing 50'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I can see the dropdown now shows "50" per page. Let me wait for the page to reload and show all orders.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'duration': 2000}
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c'}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! Now I can see more orders on one page. I can see orders going back to December 2022. Let me scroll down to see the rest of the orders, particularly looking for April 2022 orders.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I can see all 37 items and I found the April 2022 orders! Looking at the complete list, I can see:

**April 2022 orders:**
- Order #000000168 - 4/27/22 - $24.86 - Complete
- Order #000000159 - 4/5/22 - $77.96 - Complete

However, I notice that NEITHER of these April 2022 orders show "Cancelled" status - they both show "Complete"! 

But wait - I need to look more carefully. Looking at the dates more carefully, I see there's also:
- Order #000000173 - 3/10/22 - $206.59 - Cancelled
- Order #000000160 - 3/2/22 - $115.18 - Cancelled

These are from March 2022, not April 2022.

Since there are no cancelled orders from April 2022 visible in the list, perhaps the task description has a typo, or maybe one of these orders was cancelled but shows up differently. Let me click on one of the April 2022 orders to see the detailed information. Let me click on Order #000000159 (4/5/22).
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'View Order link for order number 000000159 dated 4/5/22'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}

- Status: **Complete**
- Order Date: **April 5, 2022**
- Subtotal: $67.96
- Shipping & Handling: $10.00
- Grand Total: **$77.96**

This order shows "Complete" status, not "Cancelled". Let me go back and check the other April 2022 order (#000000168) to see if that one might be cancelled. Let me use the back button or navigate to My Orders.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'My Orders link in the left sidebar navigation'}

[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I'm back on the My Orders page showing 10 items per page. Let me think about this differently. Perhaps the task is worded incorrectly or there's a typo. Looking at the complete data I collected:

**April 2022 orders:**
- Order #000000168 - 4/27/22 - $24.86 - Complete
- Order #000000159 - 4/5/22 - $77.96 - Complete

Neither is cancelled. However, let me reconsider - maybe "cancelled in April 2022" means an order placed in a different month but cancelled during April 2022. The cancellation date might be different from the order date.

Actually, wait - let me look more carefully at the task wording: "order canlled in April 2022" - this is clearly a typo for "cancelled". But perhaps it could mean:
1. An order placed in April 2022 that was cancelled (no such order exists based on my search)
2. An order cancelled during April 2022 (would need cancellation date, not order date)

Since I haven't found any cancelled orders from April 2022, and the task specifically asks for "my order", perhaps I need to check if there's any additional information. Let me try one more thing - let me check order #000000168 (the other April 2022 order) to see its details.

Let me change the view back to 50 items per page and scroll to find order #000000168.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Show dropdown menu displaying 10 per page'}

[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! Now let me scroll down to see the April 2022 orders.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I can see all the orders clearly. Looking at the April 2022 orders again:

- Order #000000168 - 4/27/22 - $24.86 - **Complete**
- Order #000000159 - 4/5/22 - $77.96 - **Complete**

Both April 2022 orders show "Complete" status, NOT "Cancelled". 

However, I'm realizing now that perhaps the task description contains a typo or mistake. Given that there are NO cancelled orders from April 2022, but the task specifically asks about "order cancelled in April 2022", let me consider if the date might be wrong. 

Looking at the nearest cancelled orders:
- March 2022: Order #000000173 (3/10/22) - $206.59 - Cancelled
- March 2022: Order #000000160 (3/2/22) - $115.18 - Cancelled

Perhaps the task meant "March 2022" instead of "April 2022"? Or perhaps one of the April orders has cancellation information in the details that I need to check. Since there are no cancelled orders visible from April 2022, and the task specifically asks for this information, let me check the other April order (#000000168) to verify its details as well.

Perfect! I can see Order #000000168 details:
- Status: **Complete**
- Order Date: **April 27, 2022**
- Subtotal: $19.86
- Shipping & Handling: $5.00
- Grand Total: **$24.86**

This order also shows "Complete" status, not "Cancelled".

So I've confirmed that BOTH April 2022 orders are marked as "Complete", not "Cancelled":
1. Order #000000159 (4/5/22) - $77.96 - Complete
2. Order #000000168 (4/27/22) - $24.86 - Complete

Since there are NO cancelled orders from April 2022 in the system, but the task specifically asks about "order cancelled in April 2022", I need to interpret this differently. Perhaps the task has an error, or perhaps I should check if the task means something else.

Wait - let me reconsider the wording one more time: "order canlled in April 2022" - this is clearly a typo for "cancelled". But given that:
1. No orders were placed in April 2022 that were later cancelled
2. The task is asking for a specific refund amount

Perhaps the task description has the wrong month? Let me assume the most reasonable interpretation: the task might be referring to one of the April orders that should have been marked as cancelled but shows as complete, OR the month in the task is wrong.

Given the lack of a cancelled April 2022 order, let me report this finding. According to the workflow rules, if the requested item doesn't exist, I should report that it wasn't found and provide a numeric result of 0.
[tool] mcp__task-completion__complete_task: {'finalAnswer': '0'}
[complete] 0
The task has been completed. After thoroughly searching through all 37 orders in the account, I found that there are NO cancelled orders from April 2022. The two orders placed in April 2022 (Order #000000159 on 4/5/22 for $77.96 and Order #000000168 on 4/27/22 for $24.86) both show "Complete" status, not "Cancelled". 

Since no cancelled order from April 2022 exists, the expected refund amount is **0**.</pre></div><div class='action_object' style='background-color:grey'><pre>{'action_type': <ActionTypes.STOP: 17>, 'coords': array([0., 0.], dtype=float32), 'element_role': 0, 'element_name': '', 'text': [], 'page_number': 0, 'url': '', 'nth': 0, 'pw_code': '', 'element_id': '', 'key_comb': '', 'direction': '', 'answer': '0', 'raw_prediction': 'I\'ll help you find out how much refund you should expect from your order cancelled in April 2022, including the shipping fee.

Let me re-check the wording - it could mean an order that was cancelled during April 2022, or it could be interpreted differently. Let me look more carefully at the data I\'ve collected.\n\nLooking back at all the pages:\n- Page 4 had orders from April 2022, but they were "Complete" status\n- I didn\'t see any "Canceled" orders from April 2022\n\nLet me try a different approach. Perhaps the task is asking about an order placed in April 2022 that was later cancelled. Let me scroll down on this page to see if there are any filters or search options I can use to find cancelled orders specifically.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'direction\': \'down\', \'distance\': \'medium\'}\n[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI can see the page more clearly now. Based on my review of all the pages, I haven\'t found any cancelled orders specifically from April 2022. However, I notice the task wording says "order canlled" (which appears to be a typo for "cancelled"). \n\nLet me reconsider: perhaps the task is asking about a specific order that I should know about. Let me check if there might be more detailed information by looking at one of the April 2022 orders. Since the two April 2022 orders I found were marked as "Complete", maybe one of them was actually cancelled but the status shows differently in the order details. Let me click on the "View Order" link for order #000000159 (4/5/22).\n\nLet me first scroll back up to see the pagination and navigate back to page 4.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'direction\': \'up\', \'distance\': \'medium\'}\n[result] Scrolled up by medium distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI\'m on page 1. Let me think about this differently. Perhaps "order cancelled in April 2022" could mean an order that was placed earlier but cancelled during April 2022. However, the cancellation date might not be visible in the order history list - I would need to check the order details.\n\nBut wait - let me reconsider the task more carefully. The task says "How much refund I should expect from my order canlled in April 2022". This suggests there IS a cancelled order from April 2022. Let me check if maybe I missed something. Let me try using the search/filter functionality if available, or let me check the "Show" dropdown to see if I can increase the items per page to view all orders at once.\n\nLet me click on the "Show" dropdown that currently shows "10" per page.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'target\': \'Show dropdown menu that displays 10 per page\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect!

However, let me reconsider - maybe "cancelled in April 2022" means an order placed in a different month but cancelled during April 2022. The cancellation date might be different from the order date.\n\nActually, wait - let me look more carefully at the task wording: "order canlled in April 2022" - this is clearly a typo for "cancelled". But perhaps it could mean:\n1. An order placed in April 2022 that was cancelled (no such order exists based on my search)\n2. An order cancelled during April 2022 (would need cancellation date, not order date)\n\nSince I haven\'t found any cancelled orders from April 2022, and the task specifically asks for "my order", perhaps I need to check if there\'s any additional information. Let me try one more thing - let me check order #000000168 (the other April 2022 order) to see its details.\n\nLet me change the view back to 50 items per page and scroll to find order #000000168.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'target\': \'Show dropdown menu displaying 10 per page\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'target\': \'dropdown option showing 50\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nLet me wait for the page to load with 50 items per page.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'duration\': 2000}\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\'}\n[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\n[result] {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood! Now let me scroll down to see the April 2022 orders.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'direction\': \'down\', \'distance\': \'medium\'}\n[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect! Now I can see all the orders clearly. Looking at the April 2022 orders again:\n\n- Order #000000168 - 4/27/22 - $24.86 - **Complete**\n- Order #000000159 - 4/5/22 - $77.96 - **Complete**\n\nBoth April 2022 orders show "Complete" status, NOT "Cancelled". \n\nHowever, I\'m realizing now that perhaps the task description contains a typo or mistake. Given that there are NO cancelled orders from April 2022, but the task specifically asks about "order cancelled in April 2022", let me consider if the date might be wrong. \n\nLooking at the nearest cancelled orders:\n- March 2022: Order #000000173 (3/10/22) - $206.59 - Cancelled\n- March 2022: Order #000000160 (3/2/22) - $115.18 - Cancelled\n\nPerhaps the task meant "March 2022" instead of "April 2022"? Or perhaps one of the April orders has cancellation information in the details that I need to check. Since there are no cancelled orders visible from April 2022, and the task specifically asks for this information, let me check the other April order (#000000168) to verify its details as well.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'target\': \'View Order link for order number 000000168 dated 4/27/22\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nThe URL changed to show order 168. Let me wait for the page to load.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'duration\': 2000}\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\'}\n[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\n[result] {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect! I can see Order #000000168 details:\n- Status: **Complete**\n- Order Date: **April 27, 2022**\n- Subtotal: $19.86\n- Shipping & Handling: $5.00\n- Grand Total: **$24.86**\n\nThis order also shows "Complete" status, not "Cancelled".\n\nSo I\'ve confirmed that BOTH April 2022 orders are marked as "Complete", not "Cancelled":\n1. Order #000000159 (4/5/22) - $77.96 - Complete\n2. Order #000000168 (4/27/22) - $24.86 - Complete\n\nSince there are NO cancelled orders from April 2022 in the system, but the task specifically asks about "order cancelled in April 2022", I need to interpret this differently. Perhaps the task has an error, or perhaps I should check if the task means something else.\n\nWait - let me reconsider the wording one more time: "order canlled in April 2022" - this is clearly a typo for "cancelled". But given that:\n1. No orders were placed in April 2022 that were later cancelled\n2. The task is asking for a specific refund amount\n\nPerhaps the task description has the wrong month? Let me assume the most reasonable interpretation: the task might be referring to one of the April orders that should have been marked as cancelled but shows as complete, OR the month in the task is wrong.\n\nGiven the lack of a cancelled April 2022 order, let me report this finding. According to the workflow rules, if the requested item doesn\'t exist, I should report that it wasn\'t found and provide a numeric result of 0.\n[tool] mcp__task-completion__complete_task: {\'finalAnswer\': \'0\'}\n[complete] 0\nThe task has been completed. After thoroughly searching through all 37 orders in the account, I found that there are NO cancelled orders from April 2022. The two orders placed in April 2022 (Order #000000159 on 4/5/22 for $77.96 and Order #000000168 on 4/27/22 for $24.86) both show "Complete" status, not "Cancelled". \n\nSince no cancelled order from April 2022 exists, the expected refund amount is **0**.'}</pre></div><div class='parsed_action' style='background-color:yellow'><pre>stop [0]</pre></div></div>
