Excellent! The search results are showing several tea cafes. I can see the results listed on the left panel. Looking at the map on the right, it appears to be zoomed in to a specific area. However, I notice these results include locations in New York (Brooklyn, Staten Island, etc.) which are far from Pittsburgh. 

Let me look for tea cafes specifically in Pittsburgh near the University. Let me scroll down in the search results to see if there are any Pittsburgh locations, or I need to refine my search to be more location-specific.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}

1. **Rose Tea Cafe** - South Craig Street, Bellefield, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, 15213, United States
2. **I Tea Cafe** - Bellefonte Street, Shadyside, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, 15232, United States

These are the Pittsburgh locations. Let me click on each one to see which is closer to the University of Pittsburgh. Let me start with Rose Tea Cafe.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Rose Tea Cafe, South Craig Street, Bellefield, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, 15213, United States link'}

Great! I can see Rose Tea Cafe is now displayed on the map. Looking at the location, it appears to be very close to the University of Pittsburgh area. I can see it's on South Craig Street in the Bellefield neighborhood, and the map shows it's near "Carnegie Mellon University" and other university buildings.

Now I need to get directions from University of Pittsburgh to Rose Tea Cafe to calculate the walking distance. Let me look for a way to get directions. In OpenStreetMap, I should be able to right-click on the map or use a directions feature. Let me first take note of this location, then search back to University of Pittsburgh and try to get walking directions.

Actually, let me try a better approach - I'll look for a "Directions" button or feature. Let me check if I can see the address details by scrolling down in the left panel.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'short'}

Actually, let me try clicking on "Where is this?" link to see what options are available.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Where is this? link at the top next to the search box'}

The map zoomed out to show the broader Pittsburgh area. I can see Rose Tea Cafe marked with an orange marker in the Pittsburgh area. Now I need to find a way to get directions. Let me try right-clicking on the map at the Rose Tea Cafe location to see if there's a "Directions from here" or "Directions to here" option.

Actually, let me try a different approach. Let me click on the small directions icon (the route planning icon) if there is one, or I can try right-clicking directly on the Rose Tea Cafe marker. Let me zoom back in first.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Orange marker for Rose Tea Cafe in the Pittsburgh area'}

[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! A directions panel has opened on the left side. I can see:
- "From" field with a green marker
- The destination is already set (Carnegie Mellon University, Schenley Drive) - shown with a red marker on the map
- Transport mode is set to "Car (OSRM)"

However, I need to:
1. Change the "From" location to "University of Pittsburgh"
2. Change the transport mode from "Car" to walking/foot

Let me first click on the transport mode dropdown to change it to walking.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Car (OSRM) dropdown menu'}

Let me click on "Foot (OSRM)" to get walking directions.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Foot (OSRM) option in the dropdown menu'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! Now the transport mode is set to "Foot (OSRM)" for walking directions. Now I need to change the "From" location to "University of Pittsburgh". Let me click on the "From" field and enter "University of Pittsburgh".
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'From text input field'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Let me type "University of Pittsburgh" in the From field. First, let me select all the text and replace it.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'keys': ['control', 'a']}

[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I can see "University of Pittsburgh" is now entered in the From field. Now let me click the "Go" button to get the walking directions.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Go button next to the Foot (OSRM) dropdown'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see that the "From" field now shows "University of Pittsburgh, 4200, Fifth Avenue..." which means it's been resolved. However, I don't see the route displayed yet or the distance information. Let me wait a moment for the route to calculate and then take a screenshot to see if the directions have been generated.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I notice the route hasn't been calculated yet. Let me scroll down in the left panel to see if there are any directions or distance information displayed below.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'short'}
[result] Scrolled down by short distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the map has zoomed out and shows only the destination marker (Rose Tea Cafe). The map appears to be loading or there's an issue with the route calculation. Let me try a different approach. Let me zoom in on the map to see the route better by clicking the zoom in button, or let me check the destination field. Let me scroll back up to see if there's a "To" field that I need to verify.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'short'}
[result] Scrolled up by short distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the map is now showing Pittsburgh area with the destination marker. I notice I only see the "From" field in the directions panel. I need to check if there's a "To" field. Let me look at the URL - I can see it has coordinates in the URL. Let me try closing this directions panel and starting fresh with a proper route. Let me click the X to close the panel.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'X button to close the directions panel on the left'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! The panel is closed and I can see the map of the Pittsburgh area. Let me try a different approach. Since I know Rose Tea Cafe is in Bellefield near the University of Pittsburgh, let me search for it again and check if there are other tea cafes closer, or I can manually check the distance. Actually, looking at the earlier search results, I saw two Pittsburgh tea cafes:

1. Rose Tea Cafe - South Craig Street, Bellefield, Pittsburgh
2. I Tea Cafe - Bellefonte Street, Shadyside, Pittsburgh

Bellefield is very close to University of Pittsburgh (Oakland area), so Rose Tea Cafe is likely the closest. Let me search specifically for "Rose Tea Cafe Pittsburgh" and then try to get walking directions.
