Good! I can see I'm already on the One Stop Market website. I can see the homepage with various products displayed. Now I need to search for "teeth grinding mouth guard" to find the price range. Let me use the search bar at the top of the page.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'Search entire store here... textbox in the header'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good, the search box should be focused now. Let me type "teeth grinding mouth guard" to search for these products.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'content': 'teeth grinding mouth guard', 'pressEnterAfterType': True}
[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the page is loading (there's a loading indicator). Let me wait for the search results to load.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! The search results are now loaded. I can see "Search results for: 'teeth grinding mouth guard'" and it shows "Items 1-12 of 4944" which means there are many products. I can see several mouth guards already displayed with their prices:

1. Leesgel Kids Mouth Guard - $14.99
2. Reazeal Mouth Guard - $14.90
3. Mouth Guard, Professional Anti Grinding Night Guard - $21.07
4. Mouth Guard Night Guard for Grinding - $9.27

However, I need to see all the products to determine the full price range. Let me scroll down to see more products and get a better sense of the complete price range.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I can see more products now with additional prices:

- foqitowi Sport Mouth Guard - $12.90
- EXCEART Moldable Mouth Guard - $7.99
- Dentemp Ora-GUARD Custom Fit Dental Guard - $49.99
- BESPORTBLE 2 Pcs Night Guard - $9.09

So far I've seen prices ranging from $7.99 to $49.99. However, with 4944 items, I should use the sorting feature to find the lowest and highest prices more efficiently. Let me scroll back up to use the "Sort By" dropdown to sort by price.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled up by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I'm back at the top of the search results. I can see the "Sort By" dropdown is currently set to "Relevance". Let me click on it to see the sorting options available, particularly to sort by price (low to high and high to low).
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'Sort By dropdown menu showing Relevance'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Great! The dropdown menu is now open and I can see three options:
- Product Name
- Price
- Relevance (currently selected)

Let me click on "Price" to sort by price, which will help me find the price range.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'Price option in the dropdown menu'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I can see the page is loading (there's a loading indicator at the top). The "Sort By" is now set to "Price". Let me wait for the page to finish loading so I can see the products sorted by price.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Interesting! The page has loaded and sorted by price, but I'm seeing very expensive items that don't appear to be mouth guards:
- Samsung TV - $7,149.00
- Copper Dragon Ornaments - $5,097.62
- Turntable - $3,809.47
- Floor Lamp - $3,659.39

These are clearly not teeth grinding mouth guards. The search returned 4944 items, which seems like it's including many unrelated products. Let me scroll down to see if there are actual mouth guards with lower prices, or I need to look at the arrow next to the "Sort By" to see if I can change the sort direction (ascending vs descending).
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'Upward arrow next to the Price dropdown'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The page is loading. Let me wait for it to complete and see if the sort order changes.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! Now the sort order has changed and I'm seeing the lowest-priced items first. I can see several items priced at $0.01:

1. Care Thread Peeling Stick Oral Gum Hygiene ToothPicks Teeth Clea - $0.01
2. Orangeeia Tooth Gaps and Temporary Adhesive Teeth FalseTeeth Glue Kit - $0.01
3. 10pcs Foot Rasp Foot File Callus Remover Kit Foot Care Pedicure - $0.01
4. Kids Toothbrush Food Grade Soft Silicone U Shaped Brush - $0.01

These are not all mouth guards, but the search is showing items with $0.01 as the lowest price. Now I need to find the highest price for actual teeth grinding mouth guards. Let me click the arrow again to sort by descending price (highest to lowest) and look for the actual mouth guards.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'Downward arrow next to the Price dropdown'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I see the dropdown menu has opened showing the sort options. The "Price" option is currently selected (highlighted in blue). Let me click elsewhere to close this dropdown and instead try a different approach. Let me use the category filters on the left side to narrow down to actual teeth grinding mouth guards. I notice "Health & Household" category which might be more relevant.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'keys': ['escape']}
[result] Keys pressed successfully
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608'}
[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good, the dropdown is closed. I can see the items are sorted by price (ascending - lowest to highest) showing $0.01 items. The search is returning 4944 items which includes many non-mouth guard products. Let me try refining my search by searching for just "mouth guard" which might give more relevant results. But first, let me look at the categories on the left. I can see "Health & Household (21)" which might have the actual mouth guards. Let me click on that category filter.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'Health & Household( 21) link in the Shopping Options Category section'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The page is loading. Let me wait for it to complete.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I've filtered to "Health & Household" category and the results show "Items 1-12 of 21" which is much more manageable. I can see the items are still sorted by price (ascending). The current visible items are:

1. Zig-Zag Premium Cigarette Roller - $4.99
2. EZY DOSE Ear and Ear Wax Cleaner - $5.99
3. Dustpan and Brush - $10.99
4. No/Brand Round Blue Light Blocking Glasses - $12.99

However, these are still not teeth grinding mouth guards. Let me scroll down to see if there are actual mouth guards in this filtered category, or I may need to try a different approach.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I'm seeing more items but still no actual teeth grinding mouth guards:
- ChipMonk Keto Cookie Bites - $14.99
- SOJOS Blue Light Blocking Computer Glasses - $15.99
- Handmade Cheese Shaped Aromatherapy Candles - $16.00
- Baby Orajel Tooth & Gum Cleanser - $16.22

This Health & Household filter (21 items) doesn't seem to contain actual mouth guards. Let me go back and try a different approach. Let me remove this filter and look at "Sports & Outdoors" category instead, as mouth guards are often used in sports. Let me scroll back up.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled up by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good, I'm back at the top. I can see the filter is currently set to "Health & Household" with 21 items, showing items starting from $4.99. Let me click "Remove This Item" or "Clear All" to remove the Health & Household filter and try the "Sports & Outdoors" category instead.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'Clear All link in the Now Shopping by section'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
It's loading. Let me wait for it to complete.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! Now I'm back to the full search results with 4944 items, still sorted by price (ascending). I can see items at $0.01. Let me try a different strategy. Instead of filtering by category, let me try searching for a more specific term like "night guard" which is another common name for teeth grinding mouth guards. But first, let me check if I scroll through the current results, can I find actual mouth guards. Let me scroll down a bit to look for actual mouth guards in the sorted list.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see more items priced at $0.01, including:
- 60ml Bare Inflator Organizer - $0.01
- Yuanl Tongue Scraper - $0.01
- Women's Makeup Brushes - $0.01
- Silicone Toothbrush Soft Bristle Mouth Cleaning U-shaped - $0.01

Still no actual teeth grinding mouth guards visible. The search is too broad and includes many irrelevant items. Let me try a more specific search. Let me click on the search bar and search for just "mouth guard" which should give more focused results.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'long'}
[result] Scrolled up by long distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good, I'm back at the top. Let me try a new, more specific search. Let me click on the search box and clear it, then search for just "mouth guard" or "night guard" to get more relevant results.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'Search textbox containing teeth grinding mouth guard at the top of page'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I see the URL bar is now selected. Let me press Escape to close that and instead click on the actual search box on the page.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'keys': ['escape']}
[result] Keys pressed successfully
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608'}
[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Let me think about this differently. The search for "teeth grinding mouth guard" returns 4944 items which includes many unrelated products. From my earlier exploration when sorted by relevance, I did see actual mouth guards with prices like:
- $9.27
- $14.90
- $14.99
- $21.07
- $49.99

And when sorted by price ascending, I saw items starting at $0.01.

However, given the large number of results (4944), those $0.01 items may not actually be teeth grinding mouth guards. Let me go back to sorting by relevance to see the actual mouth guard products, and then I can manually check a range of prices to determine the actual price range for teeth grinding mouth guards specifically.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'Sort By dropdown showing Price'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! The dropdown is open. Let me click on "Relevance" to sort by relevance, which should show the most relevant teeth grinding mouth guards.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'Relevance option in the dropdown menu'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The page is loading. Let me wait for it to finish loading so I can see the results sorted by relevance.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now the page has loaded and is sorted by "Relevance". However, I'm seeing products that are NOT teeth grinding mouth guards:
- Sweet Japanese Matcha Green Tea - $24.99
- Himalayan Chef Himalayan Pink Salt - $14.99
- Be Gud's Apple Cider Vinegar Shots - (price not visible)
- No Whey Foods - Milkless Peppermint Bark - $10.95

These are still not relevant! The search is returning too many irrelevant results. Let me scroll down to see if there are actual mouth guards further down the page.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Still seeing food items:
- Miss Jones Baking Organic Cookie Mix - $15.31
- Black Jewell Gourmet Popcorn - $23.99
- L'Oréal Paris Colour Riche Le Gloss - $7.45
- Crispy Chilies Sesame Snack - $16.97

This search is clearly not working well. Let me try a completely different approach. Let me search for just "mouth guard" without "teeth grinding" to see if that gives better results. Let me scroll back to the top and modify the search.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'long'}
[result] Scrolled up by long distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I'm back at the top of the relevance-sorted results, but these are still showing food and beauty products, not mouth guards. The search term "teeth grinding mouth guard" is clearly causing issues with the search algorithm. Let me try to navigate to the One Stop Market homepage and look for a different way to find mouth guards. Let me click on the One Stop Market logo to go to the homepage.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'One Stop Market logo at the top left'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The page didn't navigate. Let me try a different approach - let me search for just "night guard" which is a common term for teeth grinding mouth guards. Let me clear the search box and try a new search.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'Search entire store here textbox at top right of page'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I notice there's no visible search box on the current view. Let me scroll up to find the search box at the very top of the page.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'long'}
[result] Scrolled up by long distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I can see the search box at the top with "teeth grinding mouth guard" in it. Let me clear this and search for just "night guard" which should give more focused results.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'Search textbox containing teeth grinding mouth guard'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good, the search box should be focused. Let me select all the text and replace it with "night guard".
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'keys': ['control', 'a']}

[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I can see "night guard" is now in the search box and the page is loading (there's a loading indicator at the top). Let me wait for the search results to load.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! Now I'm getting much better results! The search for "night guard" returns 7725 items and I can see actual mouth guards/night guards:

I see the results are now sorted by price, but I'm seeing beds and furniture instead of night guards:
- JTJxop Platform Bed Frame
- JTJxop Upholstered Bed
- SND-A New Convertible Sleeper Sofa Bed
- SND-A Modern Sleeper Sofa Couch

This indicates that when sorted by price (ascending), the lowest-priced items in the "night guard" search are beds, not actual mouth guards. This suggests the search is still too broad. However, I did see actual night guards when sorted by relevance with prices like $17.99, $62.87, and $89.00.

Let me scroll down to see if there are actual night guards/mouth guards further down in the price-sorted list, or let me check the highest prices by clicking the sort direction arrow.

- Satiable Women's Lingerie - $0.01

This confirms that the "night guard teeth" search also includes unrelated items like beds. However, I did see actual mouth guards when sorted by relevance earlier. Let me scroll down to see where the actual mouth guards appear in the price-sorted list to get a sense of their price range.

Let me click on that category filter.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'target\': \'Health & Household( 21) link in the Shopping Options Category section\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nThe page is loading.

Instead of filtering by category, let me try searching for a more specific term like "night guard" which is another common name for teeth grinding mouth guards. But first, let me check if I scroll through the current results, can I find actual mouth guards. Let me scroll down a bit to look for actual mouth guards in the sorted list.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'direction\': \'down\', \'distance\': \'medium\'}\n[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI can see more items priced at $0.01, including:\n- 60ml Bare Inflator Organizer - $0.01\n- Yuanl Tongue Scraper - $0.01\n- Women\'s Makeup Brushes - $0.01\n- Silicone Toothbrush Soft Bristle Mouth Cleaning U-shaped - $0.01\n\nStill no actual teeth grinding mouth guards visible. The search is too broad and includes many irrelevant items. Let me try a more specific search. Let me click on the search bar and search for just "mouth guard" which should give more focused results.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'direction\': \'up\', \'distance\': \'long\'}\n[result] Scrolled up by long distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood, I\'m back at the top. Let me try a new, more specific search. Let me click on the search box and clear it, then search for just "mouth guard" or "night guard" to get more relevant results.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'target\': \'Search textbox containing teeth grinding mouth guard at the top of page\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI see the URL bar is now selected.

The search for "teeth grinding mouth guard" returns 4944 items which includes many unrelated products. From my earlier exploration when sorted by relevance, I did see actual mouth guards with prices like:\n- $9.27\n- $14.90\n- $14.99\n- $21.07\n- $49.99\n\nAnd when sorted by price ascending, I saw items starting at $0.01.\n\nHowever, given the large number of results (4944), those $0.01 items may not actually be teeth grinding mouth guards. Let me go back to sorting by relevance to see the actual mouth guard products, and then I can manually check a range of prices to determine the actual price range for teeth grinding mouth guards specifically.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'target\': \'Sort By dropdown showing Price\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood!

However, I\'m seeing products that are NOT teeth grinding mouth guards:\n- Sweet Japanese Matcha Green Tea - $24.99\n- Himalayan Chef Himalayan Pink Salt - $14.99\n- Be Gud\'s Apple Cider Vinegar Shots - (price not visible)\n- No Whey Foods - Milkless Peppermint Bark - $10.95\n\nThese are still not relevant!

Let me try a completely different approach. Let me search for just "mouth guard" without "teeth grinding" to see if that gives better results. Let me scroll back to the top and modify the search.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'direction\': \'up\', \'distance\': \'long\'}\n[result] Scrolled up by long distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI\'m back at the top of the relevance-sorted results, but these are still showing food and beauty products, not mouth guards.
