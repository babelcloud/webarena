I can see there's a Postmill tab open (which is likely the Reddit-like test website). Let me switch to that tab and take a screenshot to see the current state.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__switch_tab: {'boxId': '47572926-6338-4495-b4a9-5343a6cd4e0b', 'tabId': '2'}

- URL field (optional)
- Title field (required - marked with *)
- Body field
- Forum dropdown (already set to "DIY")
- Create submission button

According to the instructions for Postmill, I should put all content including any URLs in the Body field and leave the URL field empty. Now I need to create a post about what Midjourney could help with in the DIY field. Let me compose a relevant post.

First, let me click on the Title field and enter a title.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '47572926-6338-4495-b4a9-5343a6cd4e0b', 'target': 'Title text input field'}

Here are some ways it could help the DIY field:\n\n**Project Visualization**: Before starting a project, you could generate realistic mockups of what your finished piece might look like. Whether it's a custom bookshelf, a garden layout, or a room renovation, you can visualize different styles and color schemes without spending a dime.\n\n**Design Inspiration**: Stuck on ideas? Midjourney can generate countless design variations based on your prompts. You could explore different aesthetic directions for furniture builds, home decor, or craft projects.\n\n**Material and Finish Planning**: Generate images showing how different materials, stains, or paint colors would look on your project before you commit to purchasing supplies.\n\n**Custom Templates and Patterns**: Create unique patterns for woodworking, sewing, or other crafts. You could generate intricate designs for inlays, stencils, or decorative elements.\n\n**Problem-Solving Visualization**: When you're trying to figure out how to approach a tricky build, you could generate images showing different construction methods or assembly approaches.\n\nWhat do you all think? Has anyone tried using AI image generation for their DIY projects? I'd love to hear about your experiences!", 'pressEnterAfterType': False}

A dialog box has appeared asking "Leave site?" with the message "Changes you made may not be saved." This is likely a browser navigation confirmation. I can see there's also a Preview section showing the formatted post below. I should click "Leave" to proceed with submitting the post, or I need to look more carefully - it seems the page is showing a preview. Let me click "Cancel" to stay on the page and look for the actual submit button.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '47572926-6338-4495-b4a9-5343a6cd4e0b', 'target': 'Cancel button in the dialog'}

Good! The dialog is closed. I can see the form with the Title, Body, and a Preview section showing how the post will look. I need to scroll down to see the Forum dropdown and the "Create submission" button to actually submit the post.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '47572926-6338-4495-b4a9-5343a6cd4e0b', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I can see the complete form with:
- The Title field with my title

Here are some ways it could help the DIY field:\\n\\n**Project Visualization**: Before starting a project, you could generate realistic mockups of what your finished piece might look like. Whether it\'s a custom bookshelf, a garden layout, or a room renovation, you can visualize different styles and color schemes without spending a dime.\\n\\n**Design Inspiration**: Stuck on ideas? Midjourney can generate countless design variations based on your prompts. You could explore different aesthetic directions for furniture builds, home decor, or craft projects.\\n\\n**Material and Finish Planning**: Generate images showing how different materials, stains, or paint colors would look on your project before you commit to purchasing supplies.\\n\\n**Custom Templates and Patterns**: Create unique patterns for woodworking, sewing, or other crafts. You could generate intricate designs for inlays, stencils, or decorative elements.\\n\\n**Problem-Solving Visualization**: When you\'re trying to figure out how to approach a tricky build, you could generate images showing different construction methods or assembly approaches.\\n\\nWhat do you all think?
