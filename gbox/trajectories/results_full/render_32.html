Perfect! I can see the search results now. I found several hotels near Pittsburgh Airport, and I can see there's a Hilton hotel listed:

**"Hilton Garden Inn Pittsburgh Airport South-Robinson Mall, 303, Park Manor Drive, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, 15205, United States"**

Now I need to:
1. Click on this Hilton hotel to see its exact location on the map
2. Then search for nearby supermarkets owned by local companies
3. Calculate the walking distance

Let me click on the Hilton Garden Inn result.

Excellent! I've found the Hilton Garden Inn Pittsburgh Airport South-Robinson Mall. I can see it's located at:
- **303 Park Manor Drive, Pittsburgh, PA 15205, US**

Now I can see the hotel is marked on the map. I need to search for nearby supermarkets, specifically ones owned by local companies. Let me search for supermarkets near this location. First, let me close this info panel and search for supermarkets.

Good! Now I can see the hotel location on the map. I need to search for supermarkets near this location. Let me zoom out a bit to see the surrounding area better, and then search for supermarkets.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Search box in top left'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Let me search for supermarkets near this location. I'll type "supermarket near Park Manor Drive Pittsburgh" to find nearby supermarkets.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'content': 'supermarket near Park Manor Drive Pittsburgh', 'pressEnterAfterType': False}

Good! I can see the map is zoomed in on the hotel area. I can see "First Commonwealth Bank" in the upper right. Let me zoom out to see a wider area and look for supermarkets. I'll use the minus button to zoom out.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Minus zoom out button on the right side of the map'}

Better! I can see a wider area now with more buildings and commercial areas. I can see various small orange/yellow icons that might represent shops. Let me try a different search approach. Let me search for "Giant Eagle Pittsburgh" which is a well-known local supermarket chain in Pittsburgh.

Excellent! Now I can see the area much better with labels. I can see "Robinson Town Center" at the top and "Robinson Court" on the right side. The Hilton Garden Inn is clearly visible in the center. Let me search for "Giant Eagle Robinson Pittsburgh" to find the nearest Giant Eagle supermarket, which is a local Pittsburgh supermarket chain.

I see "No results found" for Giant Eagle in this specific search. Let me try a different approach. I can see "Robinson Town Center" on the map - this is likely a shopping area that might have supermarkets. Let me click on one of the visible store icons on the map to see what businesses are nearby, or let me try searching for shops or markets more broadly in this area. Let me close this search panel first and explore the map visually.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'X button to close search results panel'}

Good! Now I can see the map clearly. I can see "Robinson Town Center" which is a shopping area at the top of the map. Let me click on that area to see what stores are there, as shopping centers typically have supermarkets. Let me click on the "Robinson Town Center" text.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Robinson Town Center text label at the top of the map'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The click didn't open any information. Let me try a different approach. I'll zoom in on the Robinson Town Center area to see what stores are marked there. Let me click on the area to zoom in or try clicking on one of the building icons in that shopping center area.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Large parking lot area under Robinson Town Center text'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Let me try a different strategy. I'll search more specifically for "Shop-n-Save" which is another Pittsburgh-area local grocery chain, or I can search for specific addresses. Let me search for "Robinson Town Center" directly to see if I can get directions or route information that would help identify nearby supermarkets.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Search box in top left'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Let me try searching for "Shop-n-Save Robinson" which is a local Pittsburgh grocery chain that might be in this area.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'content': 'Shop-n-Save Robinson', 'pressEnterAfterType': False}
[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Now let me click Go to search for Shop-n-Save.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Blue Go button next to search box'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
"No results found" again. It seems OpenStreetMap might not have specific supermarket locations tagged in this test environment. Let me use the Wikipedia subagent to get information about local Pittsburgh supermarket chains near the airport and their locations. This would be more reliable.
[tool] Task: {'subagent_type': 'wikipedia-researcher', 'description': 'Find local Pittsburgh supermarkets', 'prompt': "I need to find information about locally-owned supermarket chains in the Pittsburgh area, specifically near Pittsburgh International Airport or in the Robinson Township area.

[result] Perfect! Now I have comprehensive information. Let me compile the answer based on what I found in Wikipedia.

**Answer:**

Based on Wikipedia research, here are the locally-owned supermarket chai
Excellent! The Wikipedia research has identified that Giant Eagle is a major locally-owned Pittsburgh supermarket chain. Now I need to find the specific location of a Giant Eagle store near the hotel and calculate the walking distance. Let me go back to OpenStreetMap and search more carefully, or zoom in on the Robinson Town Center area to see if there are any marked stores there.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'X button to close search results panel'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Now let me zoom in on the Robinson Town Center area at the top of the screen to see if I can identify specific store buildings. Let me click the plus button to zoom in.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Plus zoom in button on right side of map'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I can see more detail. I can see:
- The Hilton Garden Inn Pittsburgh Airport South-Robinson Mall is clearly marked in the center
- "IKEA" store is visible in the upper left
- "Robinson Court" and "Park Terrace" areas are visible on the right
- There's a large area labeled with building numbers (200, 202, etc.)

Let me scroll the map up to see more of the Robinson Town Center area where a Giant Eagle might be located. Let me drag the map down to see what's north of the current view.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled up by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I can see the Hilton Garden Inn Pittsburgh Airport South-Robinson Mall on the left, and I can see "First Commonwealth Bank" and "Robinson Plaza" labeled. I can also see "Park Manor Drive" which is where the hotel is located. Let me continue scrolling to see more of the shopping area to the north where Giant Eagle might be.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled up by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The map doesn't seem to have scrolled. Let me try a different approach. Let me search for a specific address like "100 Park Manor Boulevard" or look for the Robinson Town Center shopping area more directly. Let me try clicking on one of the large retail buildings visible on the map to see if they're labeled.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Large grey building in the upper left area of the map'}

It seems the test OpenStreetMap environment might not have detailed store information. Let me try a different approach. Since I know from Wikipedia that Giant Eagle is a major local supermarket chain in Pittsburgh, and I can see the Robinson Town Center area on the map, let me try to search for a specific Giant Eagle address. Let me search for "100 Robinson Centre Drive" or similar addresses in the Robinson area where Giant Eagle stores are typically located.

Let me try searching for "100 Robinson Centre Drive Pittsburgh" which is a common address format for stores in that area.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'content': '100 Robinson Centre Drive Pittsburgh', 'pressEnterAfterType': False}

[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Still no results. It appears this test OpenStreetMap environment doesn't have detailed business listings. Given the limitations of the map data, let me provide the answer based on what I've been able to determine:

1. **Hilton Hotel**: Hilton Garden Inn Pittsburgh Airport South-Robinson Mall (confirmed from the search)
2. **Local supermarket**: Giant Eagle (confirmed as a locally-owned Pittsburgh supermarket chain from Wikipedia research)

However, I cannot determine the exact walking distance without being able to locate the specific Giant Eagle store on the map. Let me make one final attempt - let me try to use the routing feature on OpenStreetMap. Let me search for just "Robinson Centre Drive" without the number.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'X button to close search results'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Given the limitations of the test OpenStreetMap environment (which doesn't have detailed store listings), I cannot determine the exact walking distance from the map alone. However, based on my research, I have identified:

1. **Hotel name**: Hilton Garden Inn Pittsburgh Airport South-Robinson Mall
2. **Local supermarket chain**: Giant Eagle (a Pittsburgh-based, locally-owned supermarket chain)

Since I cannot get the precise walking distance from the map, let me provide the answer with the information I have confirmed. The task asks for the hotel name and walking distance to a locally-owned supermarket. I've confirmed the hotel and identified Giant Eagle as the local chain, but without the specific store location and walking distance calculation, I need to report what I've found.
[tool] mcp__task-completion__complete_task: {'finalAnswer': 'Hotel: Hilton Garden Inn Pittsburgh Airport South-Robinson Mall. Giant Eagle is a locally-owned Pittsburgh supermarket chain with presence in the Robinson Township area near the airport, but the specific walking distance from the hotel cannot be determined from the available map data.'}
[complete] Hotel: Hilton Garden Inn Pittsburgh Airport South-Robinson Mall. Giant Eagle is a locally-owned Pittsburgh supermarket chain with presence in the Robinson Township area near the airport, but the specific walking distance from the hotel cannot be determined from the available map data.
I've completed the task with the information I was able to gather:

**Hotel Name**: Hilton Garden Inn Pittsburgh Airport South-Robinson Mall

**Local Supermarket**: Giant Eagle - a Pittsburgh-based, family-owned supermarket chain that has been operating since 1918. Wikipedia confirmed it's headquartered in O'Hara Township, Pennsylvania (a Pittsburgh suburb) and is privately owned by the Shapira family.

Unfortunately, I was unable to determine the exact walking distance from the hotel to the nearest Giant Eagle location because the test OpenStreetMap environment doesn't have detailed business location data for supermarkets in the Robinson Township area. While I confirmed the hotel location and identified Giant Eagle as the relevant locally-owned supermarket chain with presence in the area, the specific store location and walking distance calculation couldn't be completed with the available map data.</pre></div><div class='action_object' style='background-color:grey'><pre>{'action_type': <ActionTypes.STOP: 17>, 'coords': array([0., 0.], dtype=float32), 'element_role': 0, 'element_name': '', 'text': [], 'page_number': 0, 'url': '', 'nth': 0, 'pw_code': '', 'element_id': '', 'key_comb': '', 'direction': '', 'answer': 'Hotel: Hilton Garden Inn Pittsburgh Airport South-Robinson Mall.

Let me go back to OpenStreetMap and search more carefully, or zoom in on the Robinson Town Center area to see if there are any marked stores there.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'target\': \'X button to close search results panel\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nNow let me zoom in on the Robinson Town Center area at the top of the screen to see if I can identify specific store buildings. Let me click the plus button to zoom in.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'target\': \'Plus zoom in button on right side of map\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect! Now I can see more detail. I can see:\n- The Hilton Garden Inn Pittsburgh Airport South-Robinson Mall is clearly marked in the center\n- "IKEA" store is visible in the upper left\n- "Robinson Court" and "Park Terrace" areas are visible on the right\n- There\'s a large area labeled with building numbers (200, 202, etc.)\n\nLet me scroll the map up to see more of the Robinson Town Center area where a Giant Eagle might be located. Let me drag the map down to see what\'s north of the current view.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'direction\': \'up\', \'distance\': \'medium\'}\n[result] Scrolled up by medium distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood! I can see the Hilton Garden Inn Pittsburgh Airport South-Robinson Mall on the left, and I can see "First Commonwealth Bank" and "Robinson Plaza" labeled. I can also see "Park Manor Drive" which is where the hotel is located. Let me continue scrolling to see more of the shopping area to the north where Giant Eagle might be.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'direction\': \'up\', \'distance\': \'medium\'}\n[result] Scrolled up by medium distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nThe map doesn\'t seem to have scrolled. Let me try a different approach. Let me search for a specific address like "100 Park Manor Boulevard" or look for the Robinson Town Center shopping area more directly. Let me try clicking on one of the large retail buildings visible on the map to see if they\'re labeled.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'target\': \'Large grey building in the upper left area of the map\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nIt seems the test OpenStreetMap environment might not have detailed store information. Let me try a different approach. Since I know from Wikipedia that Giant Eagle is a major local supermarket chain in Pittsburgh, and I can see the Robinson Town Center area on the map, let me try to search for a specific Giant Eagle address. Let me search for "100 Robinson Centre Drive" or similar addresses in the Robinson area where Giant Eagle stores are typically located.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'target\': \'Search box in top left\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nLet me try searching for "100 Robinson Centre Drive Pittsburgh" which is a common address format for stores in that area.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'content\': \'100 Robinson Centre Drive Pittsburgh\', \'pressEnterAfterType\': False}\n[result] Text typed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'target\': \'Blue Go button next to search box\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nStill no results. It appears this test OpenStreetMap environment doesn\'t have detailed business listings. Given the limitations of the map data, let me provide the answer based on what I\'ve been able to determine:\n\n1. **Hilton Hotel**: Hilton Garden Inn Pittsburgh Airport South-Robinson Mall (confirmed from the search)\n2. **Local supermarket**: Giant Eagle (confirmed as a locally-owned Pittsburgh supermarket chain from Wikipedia research)\n\nHowever, I cannot determine the exact walking distance without being able to locate the specific Giant Eagle store on the map. Let me make one final attempt - let me try to use the routing feature on OpenStreetMap. Let me search for just "Robinson Centre Drive" without the number.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'target\': \'X button to close search results\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGiven the limitations of the test OpenStreetMap environment (which doesn\'t have detailed store listings), I cannot determine the exact walking distance from the map alone. However, based on my research, I have identified:\n\n1. **Hotel name**: Hilton Garden Inn Pittsburgh Airport South-Robinson Mall\n2. **Local supermarket chain**: Giant Eagle (a Pittsburgh-based, locally-owned supermarket chain)\n\nSince I cannot get the precise walking distance from the map, let me provide the answer with the information I have confirmed. The task asks for the hotel name and walking distance to a locally-owned supermarket. I\'ve confirmed the hotel and identified Giant Eagle as the local chain, but without the specific store location and walking distance calculation, I need to report what I\'ve found.\n[tool] mcp__task-completion__complete_task: {\'finalAnswer\': \'Hotel: Hilton Garden Inn Pittsburgh Airport South-Robinson Mall. Giant Eagle is a locally-owned Pittsburgh supermarket chain with presence in the Robinson Township area near the airport, but the specific walking distance from the hotel cannot be determined from the available map data.\'}\n[complete] Hotel: Hilton Garden Inn Pittsburgh Airport South-Robinson Mall. Giant Eagle is a locally-owned Pittsburgh supermarket chain with presence in the Robinson Township area near the airport, but the specific walking distance from the hotel cannot be determined from the available map data.\nI\'ve completed the task with the information I was able to gather:\n\n**Hotel Name**: Hilton Garden Inn Pittsburgh Airport South-Robinson Mall\n\n**Local Supermarket**: Giant Eagle - a Pittsburgh-based, family-owned supermarket chain that has been operating since 1918. Wikipedia confirmed it\'s headquartered in O\'Hara Township, Pennsylvania (a Pittsburgh suburb) and is privately owned by the Shapira family.\n\nUnfortunately, I was unable to determine the exact walking distance from the hotel to the nearest Giant Eagle location because the test OpenStreetMap environment doesn\'t have detailed business location data for supermarkets in the Robinson Township area. While I confirmed the hotel location and identified Giant Eagle as the relevant locally-owned supermarket chain with presence in the area, the specific store location and walking distance calculation couldn\'t be completed with the available map data.'}</pre></div><div class='parsed_action' style='background-color:yellow'><pre>stop [Hotel: Hilton Garden Inn Pittsburgh Airport South-Robinson Mall.
