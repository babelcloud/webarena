Good! I can see there's a GitLab instance open showing a list of projects. I need to find issues with "homepage content" in the title. Let me navigate to the Issues section. I can see there's a navigation bar at the top. Let me click on the menu icon to access the Issues section.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'hamburger menu icon button with three horizontal lines in the top left corner next to the GitLab logo'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I see the page is the same. Let me look for a way to access Issues. I notice there are icons in the top navigation bar. Let me check the navigation options. I can see there's a merge request icon and other icons. Let me look for an Issues section. I'll try clicking on the menu button that shows numbers - it appears to be the issues counter next to the merge requests icon.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'icon with number 12 in a circle in the top navigation bar'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I can see the URL has changed to include "dashboard/issues?assignee_username=byteblaze", which means I've accessed the issues section. Let me take a fresh screenshot to see what's displayed on the issues page.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608'}
[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I can see the Issues page. I can see several issues listed, and I'm currently viewing "Open" issues (12 open). I need to find the latest updated issue with "homepage content" in its title. Let me look at the current list - I can see the issues are sorted by "Updated date" (there's a dropdown showing "Updated date" with a sort icon). 

I don't see any issue with "homepage content" in the visible list. Let me scroll down to see if there are more issues below.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the same issues. I still don't see any issue with "homepage content" in the title. Let me continue scrolling to see if there are more issues below.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The page doesn't seem to be scrolling further. I notice that there are 12 open issues shown at the top, but I can only see about 11-12 issues on the current view. The issue with "homepage content" might be in the closed issues. Let me check the "Closed" tab to see if the issue is there. I can see there are 33 closed issues.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'Closed 33 tab button'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I see the page still shows the same issues. Let me scroll back up to see the tab selection and make sure I'm looking at the right section. I notice there's a search bar at the top that says "Search or filter results...". Let me use that to search for "homepage content".
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'long'}
[result] Scrolled up by long distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! Now I can see the tabs clearly. I'm currently on the "Open" tab (12 issues). Let me use the search bar to search for "homepage content" across all issues. I'll click on the search bar and type the search term.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'Search or filter results text input field'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I can see a dropdown menu appeared with filter options (Author, Assignee, Milestone, Release, Label, My Reaction). Let me close this menu and just type in the search box directly to search for "homepage content".
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'content': 'homepage content', 'pressEnterAfterType': True}
[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I can see "homepage content" is now in the search box. The page is loading (there's a loading icon in the tab). Let me wait a moment for the results to load.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! The search results are now showing. I can see the URL has changed to include the search parameter "search=homepage+content". The results show "Open 8" and "Closed 32" tabs, meaning there are 40 total issues matching "homepage content".

I can see several issues but none of them have exactly "homepage content" in their visible titles. However, I notice there's an issue that says "homepage property in package.json breaking the access to the css files in the public folder." which contains "homepage" in the title. Let me scroll down to see if there are more results.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the same 8 open issues. I notice the search is finding issues that contain "homepage" or "content" in their title or description. However, the task asks for an issue with the keyword "homepage content" in its title. Let me look more carefully - I see:

- "homepage property in package.json breaking the access to the css files in the public folder." (updated 3 years ago)

This has "homepage" but not "homepage content" specifically. Let me check the "All" tab to see all issues (both open and closed) sorted by updated date to find the latest one with "homepage content" in the title.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled up by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Let me click on the "All" tab to see all issues (both open and closed) that match the search, sorted by updated date.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'All 40 tab button'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the page is loading (there's a loading indicator in the tab). Let me wait for it to complete and then take a fresh screenshot.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! Now I can see all issues that match "homepage content". I can see there's an issue titled **"Rethink the homepage's content"** which is CLOSED and was updated 2 years ago. This appears to be the issue with "homepage content" in its title.

Looking at the list sorted by "Updated date", I can see:
1. "Safari CSS issues" - updated 2 years ago (CLOSED)
2. **"Rethink the homepage's content"** - updated 2 years ago (CLOSED)
3. Other issues below...

Since the task asks for "my latest updated issue that has keyword 'homepage content' in its title", and I can see "Rethink the homepage's content" is the one that matches, let me click on it to verify its status.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': "Rethink the homepage's content issue link"}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the URL at the bottom shows it's trying to navigate to the issue. Let me wait for the page to load.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I found the issue "Rethink the homepage's content" (issue #719). I can clearly see at the top of the page that this issue has a blue badge that says **"Closed"**. The issue was created 6 years ago by Byte Blaze and is currently in the CLOSED state.

The task asked me to check if this issue is closed, and I can confirm that **YES, it is CLOSED**.
[tool] mcp__task-completion__complete_task: {'finalAnswer': 'Yes, the issue "Rethink the homepage\'s content" is closed.'}
[complete] Yes, the issue \"Rethink the homepage's content\" is closed.
The task is complete!
