Great! I can see I'm already on the comments page for user "ziosfracelle". I can see several comments with their voting information displayed on the left side of each comment. Let me create a todo list to track my progress and systematically count the comments.
[tool] TodoWrite: {'todos': [{'content': 'Analyze all visible comments for ziosfracelle and count those with more downvotes than upvotes', 'status': 'in_progress', 'activeForm': 'Analyzing visible comments for vote counts'}, {'content': 'Scroll through the entire comments section to find all comments', 'status': 'pending', 'activeForm': 'Scrolling through comments section'}, {'content': 'Complete the final count and provide answer', 'status': 'pending', 'activeForm': 'Completing final count'}]}
[result] Todos have been modified successfully. Ensure that you continue to use the todo list to track your progress. Please proceed with the current tasks if applicable
Now let me analyze the visible comments. I can see the voting information on the left side of each comment:

Looking at the current visible comments:
1. Comment 1: 0 upvotes (top), 0 downvotes (bottom) - Equal votes
2. Comment 2: 4 upvotes, 0 downvotes - More upvotes than downvotes
3. Comment 3: 1 upvote, 0 downvotes - More upvotes than downvotes
4. Comment 4: 1 upvote, 0 downvotes - More upvotes than downvotes
5. Comment 5: 6 upvotes, 0 downvotes - More upvotes than downvotes
6. Comment 6: 2 upvotes, 0 downvotes - More upvotes than downvotes

Let me scroll down to see if there are more comments.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the same content. Let me scroll down more to see if there are additional comments below.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'long'}
[result] Scrolled down by long distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
It appears that I'm seeing the same content repeatedly, which suggests I may have reached the end of the comments or there's pagination. Let me scroll back up to the top to make sure I have a complete view of all the user's comments and count them systematically.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'long'}
[result] Scrolled up by long distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I can see all the comments clearly from the top. Let me update my todo and systematically count all the comments with their vote counts.
[tool] TodoWrite: {'todos': [{'content': 'Analyze all visible comments for ziosfracelle and count those with more downvotes than upvotes', 'status': 'completed', 'activeForm': 'Analyzing visible comments for vote counts'}, {'content': 'Count all comments systematically from top to bottom', 'status': 'in_progress', 'activeForm': 'Counting comments systematically'}, {'content': 'Complete the final count and provide answer', 'status': 'pending', 'activeForm': 'Completing final count'}]}
[result] Todos have been modified successfully. Ensure that you continue to use the todo list to track your progress. Please proceed with the current tasks if applicable
Now let me count all the comments systematically. I can see the voting pattern clearly - each comment has an up arrow with a number above it and a down arrow with a number below it. Let me count from top to bottom:

**Comment 1:**
- Upvotes: 3 (top number)
- Downvotes: 0 (bottom number)
- Result: More upvotes than downvotes

**Comment 2:**
- Upvotes: 0 
- Downvotes: 0
- Result: Equal votes (not more downvotes)

**Comment 3:**
- Upvotes: 4
- Downvotes: 0  
- Result: More upvotes than downvotes

**Comment 4:**
- Upvotes: 1
- Downvotes: 0
- Result: More upvotes than downvotes

**Comment 5:**
- Upvotes: 1
- Downvotes: 0
- Result: More upvotes than downvotes

**Comment 6:**
- Upvotes: 6
- Downvotes: 0
- Result: More upvotes than downvotes

Let me scroll down to see if there are any more comments to make sure I have a complete count.

[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see this is showing me the same content as before, suggesting I've seen all the comments. Let me complete my analysis and update my todo.

Based on my systematic analysis of all of ziosfracelle's comments, here is the complete count:

**All Comments Analyzed:**
1. Comment 1: 3 upvotes, 0 downvotes → More upvotes than downvotes
2. Comment 2: 0 upvotes, 0 downvotes → Equal votes (not more downvotes)
3. Comment 3: 4 upvotes, 0 downvotes → More upvotes than downvotes  
4. Comment 4: 1 upvote, 0 downvotes → More upvotes than downvotes
5. Comment 5: 1 upvote, 0 downvotes → More upvotes than downvotes
6. Comment 6: 6 upvotes, 0 downvotes → More upvotes than downvotes

**Result:** I have examined all visible comments by ziosfracelle (the user who made the latest post on the DIY forum), and **ZERO** comments have received more downvotes than upvotes. All comments either have more upvotes than downvotes, or equal votes (0-0).
