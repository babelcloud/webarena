Good! I can see I'm on Postmill (a Reddit-like platform) and I'm currently viewing the submissions page. I can see there are several subscribed forums listed on the right side. I need to find a subreddit related to "relations" or "relationships" to ask for advice about cheating.

Looking at the subscribed forums, I don't see any relationship-related forums yet. Let me search for a relationships forum. I'll use the search bar at the top.
