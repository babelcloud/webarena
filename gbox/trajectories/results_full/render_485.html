[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I can see I'm on the GitLab Projects Dashboard. I need to find a repository called "dotfile" or something related to dotfile configurations. Let me search for it using the search functionality.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'Filter by name input field on the right side of the page'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good, the filter input field is now focused (highlighted in blue). Let me type "dotfile" to search for the repository.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'content': 'dotfile', 'pressEnterAfterType': False}
[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the search field now has "dotfile" typed in it, but the results haven't filtered yet. Let me wait a moment for the page to filter the results automatically, or I'll need to scroll down to see if there's a dotfile repository.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'duration': 1000}
[result] Finished waiting for 1000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! The filter worked and I can now see the "dotfiles" repository (Byte Blaze / dotfiles). It's described as "Computer setup" and was updated on Oct 26, 2025. Now I need to click on this repository to open it, and then access the settings to invite Vinta as a guest.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'Byte Blaze / dotfiles repository link with Computer setup description'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I see the page is loading (there's a loading indicator). Let me wait for it to fully load before proceeding.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! The dotfiles repository page has loaded. I can see the repository details and on the left sidebar, there's a "Settings" option. I need to click on "Settings" to access the repository settings where I can invite Vinta as a guest.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'Settings link in the left sidebar navigation menu'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Great! A settings submenu has appeared. I can see several options including General, Integrations, Webhooks, Access Tokens, Repository, Merge requests, CI/CD, Packages and registries, Monitor, and Usage Quotas. To invite a user as a guest, I typically need to look in the "General" section or possibly a "Members" section. Let me click on "General" first.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'General option in the settings submenu'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I'm now on the General Settings page. I can see sections for "Naming, topics, avatar" and "Visibility, project features, permissions". However, to invite a user as a guest, I typically need to find a "Members" section. Let me look at the left sidebar again - I notice in GitLab, there's usually a "Project information" section that might contain Members. Let me click on "Project information" in the left sidebar.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'Project information link in the left sidebar'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I can see a submenu has appeared under "Project information" with three options: Activity, Labels, and **Members**. I need to click on "Members" to access the member management page where I can invite Vinta as a guest.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'Members option in the Project information submenu'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I notice the page shows "Activity" instead of the Members management page. It seems like it redirected to the Activity feed. Let me wait for the page to fully load, as the URL shows "project_members" which suggests it should be the members page.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'duration': 1500}
[result] Finished waiting for 1500ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I'm on the Project members page. I can see there are currently 5 members listed, and there's a blue "Invite members" button in the top right corner. I need to click on "Invite members" to add Vinta as a guest.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'Invite members button in the top right corner'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! An "Invite members" modal dialog has appeared. I can see:
- A field for "Username or email address" where I need to enter "Vinta"
- A dropdown for "Select a role" which is already set to "Guest" (perfect!)
- An optional "Access expiration date" field
- Cancel and Invite buttons

The role is already set to "Guest" which is exactly what I need. Now I need to type "Vinta" in the username field.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'Username or email address input field in the Invite members modal'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! The input field is now focused (highlighted in blue). Now I'll type "Vinta" to search for the user.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'content': 'Vinta', 'pressEnterAfterType': False}
[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! A dropdown has appeared showing "Vinta Chen" with the username "vinta". This is the user I need to invite. Let me click on this user to select them.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'Vinta Chen option in the dropdown with username vinta'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! Vinta Chen has been selected and now appears as a tag in the input field. I can see:
- "Vinta Chen" is selected (with an X to remove if needed)
- The role is set to "Guest" 
- There's an optional expiration date field
- The "Invite" button is ready to be clicked

Now I need to click the "Invite" button to complete the invitation.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'Invite button at the bottom right of the modal dialog'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The modal is still open. Let me wait a moment for the invitation to process, as there might be some background processing happening.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! The task has been completed successfully! I can see:

1. A success message at the top: "Members were successfully added"
2. The member count has increased from 5 to 6
3. **Vinta Chen (@vinta)** now appears in the members list with:
   - Role: **Guest** (as requested)
   - Access granted: "just now by Byte Blaze"
   - Created on: 17 Mar, 2023
   - Expiration: Never
