I can see I'm currently on a GitLab dashboard showing various projects. I can see there's a project called "chatgpt_plugin" in the list. Since the task is to open an issue to report a connection refused issue in ChatGPT, I need to click on the chatgpt_plugin project to access it and then create an issue.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': 'chatgpt_plugin project link in the projects list'}
