Good! I can see I'm already on the One Stop Market website. I can see the main page with various product categories in the navigation menu. I need to find the "Household Supplies" category. Looking at the navigation, I can see categories like:
- Beauty & Personal Care
- Sports & Outdoors
- Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry
- Home & Kitchen
- Office Products
- Tools & Home Improvement
- Health & Household
- Patio, Lawn & Garden
- Electronics
- Cell Phones & Accessories
- Video Games
- Grocery & Gourmet Food

I notice "Health & Household" which might contain household supplies. Let me click on it to explore.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Health & Household navigation menu link'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I can see a dropdown menu appeared with subcategories:
- Household Supplies
- Health Care
- Diet & Sports Nutrition

I need to click on "Household Supplies" to see the products in that category.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Household Supplies link in dropdown menu'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Great! I'm now on the Health & Household page. I can see:
- Items 1-12 of 537 total items
- On the left, I can see filter options including "Household Supplies (277)" as a category
- There's a "Sort By" dropdown currently set to "Position"
- I can see some products with prices: $3.72, $12.98, $179.99, $4.98

To find the most expensive product in the Household Supplies category, I should:
1. First filter to show only Household Supplies items
2. Then sort by price (high to low)

Let me click on "Household Supplies" in the left sidebar to filter only those items.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Household Supplies( 277) link in the Category filter section on the left sidebar'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I'm filtering by Household Supplies only - I can see "Items 1-12 of 277" and the filter shows "Now Shopping by Category: Household Supplies". I can also see a price filter on the left with a range that goes up to "$900.00 and above".

I can see some products with prices visible:
- $3.72
- $179.99
- $4.98
- $14.87

To find the most expensive product, I need to sort by price (high to low). Let me click on the "Sort By" dropdown and change it from "Position" to sort by price descending.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Sort By dropdown menu showing Position'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Great! The dropdown menu is now open showing three sorting options:
- Position (currently selected)
- Product Name
- Price

I need to click on "Price" to sort by price. This should show the most expensive items first.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Price option in the Sort By dropdown menu'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I can see the "Sort By" dropdown now shows "Price" is selected. However, I notice the products are still showing the same items. The page might be loading or I need to check if there's an arrow to toggle between ascending and descending order. I can see there's an up arrow icon next to the sort dropdown. Let me click on it to sort in descending order (highest price first).
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'up arrow icon next to the Price sort dropdown to change sort direction'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the page has reloaded with products sorted by price, but it appears to be in ascending order (lowest to highest). I can see:
- $1.20
- $1.75
- $1.78
- $1.97

I need to sort in descending order to see the most expensive products first. The arrow icon next to the sort dropdown should toggle the direction. Let me click it again.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'up arrow icon next to the Price dropdown to reverse sort order'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I can see products sorted by price in descending order (highest to lowest). I can see several high-priced items:
- Optima OPT8042-218 Batteries: $299.99
- Powermatic III+ Cigarette Machine: $198.50
- KAMaster Wooden Side Shelves: $189.99

And I can see there's a product on the left that shows "7 Reviews" but the price is partially cut off. Let me scroll down a bit to see if there are any more expensive items or to get a better view of all the prices on this page.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86'}
[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I notice the page seems to have gone back to showing the lowest prices ($1.20, $1.75, $1.78, $1.97). It looks like the sort direction changed back to ascending. Let me scroll up to see if there are more products at the top, or I need to click the arrow again to sort descending.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled up by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the products are sorted by price ascending (lowest first). I can see the arrow icon next to "Price" dropdown. Let me click on it to change the sort direction to descending (highest price first).
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Set Descending Direction arrow button next to Price sort dropdown'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! Now I can see the products sorted by price in descending order (highest to lowest). The URL also shows "product_list_dir=desc" confirming this. I can see several products with their prices:

1. **Lynx Battery 12V 200Ah Lithium Iron Phosphate LiFePO4 Prismatic Deep Cell Battery** - **$800.00** (with 7 Reviews)
2. Optima OPT8042-218 Batteries 8042-218 D75/25 YellowTop Dual Purpose Battery - $299.99
3. Powermatic III+ Cigarette Machine - $198.50 (with 12 Reviews)
4. KAMaster Wooden Side Shelves for XLarge Big Green Egg Red Oak Wood EGG Mates - $189.99

The most expensive product is the Lynx Battery at $800.00. Let me scroll down to make sure there are no products more expensive than this one that might be cut off or verify this is indeed the most expensive.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'short'}
[result] Scrolled up by short distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the price is partially hidden. Let me scroll down slightly to see the full price of the Lynx Battery product (the first one on the left).
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'tiny'}
[result] Scrolled down by tiny distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I can clearly see the price of the first product (the most expensive one since we're sorting by price descending):

**Lynx Battery 12V 200Ah Lithium Iron Phosphate LiFePO4 Prismatic Deep Cell Battery - Set of 4-3.2V Cells with 3 Bus Bars and 8 Lug Nuts - for RV, Solar, Marine & Off-Grid Applications** - **$900.00** (with 7 Reviews)

The other visible products are:
- Optima OPT8042-218 Batteries: $299.99
- Powermatic III+ Cigarette Machine: $198.50
- KAMaster Wooden Side Shelves: $189.99

Since the items are sorted by price descending (highest to lowest), and the first item shown is $900.00, this is the most expensive product in the Household Supplies category.

Let me click on this product to get the complete name to provide the most accurate answer.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Lynx Battery 12V 200Ah Lithium Iron Phosphate LiFePO4 Prismatic Deep Cell Battery product link at $900.00'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the product name is now underlined as a link. I can read the full product name from the page:

**Lynx Battery 12V 200Ah Lithium Iron Phosphate LiFePO4 Prismatic Deep Cell Battery - Set of 4-3.2V Cells with 3 Bus Bars and 8 Lug Nuts - for RV, Solar, Marine & Off-Grid Applications**

Price: **$900.00**

This is the most expensive product in the Household Supplies category at One Stop Market. Now I have all the information needed to complete the task.
[tool] mcp__task-completion__complete_task: {'finalAnswer': 'Lynx Battery 12V 200Ah Lithium Iron Phosphate LiFePO4 Prismatic Deep Cell Battery - Set of 4-3.2V Cells with 3 Bus Bars and 8 Lug Nuts - for RV, Solar, Marine & Off-Grid Applications, $900.00'}
