Good! I can see I'm on the GitLab Projects Dashboard page. I need to find the latest created issue that has "better" in its title. To do this, I should navigate to the issues section. I can see there's a navigation menu at the top. Let me look for a way to view issues. I'll click on the menu icon or look for an "Issues" link.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'hamburger menu icon in the top left corner next to GitLab logo'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
It looks like the menu didn't open. Let me try a different approach. In GitLab, there's usually a navigation bar at the top with different sections. I can see there's a section for Issues. Let me look for the Issues link in the top navigation, or I could check if there's an "Issues" icon in the toolbar. Let me check if I can access issues through the search or navigation.

Actually, looking more carefully, I can see there are icons in the top right corner. Let me click on what appears to be an issues icon (it looks like it might be in the top navigation bar).
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'issues icon showing "12" badge in the top navigation bar'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I can see the URL has changed to show issues assigned to byteblaze. The URL shows: `dashboard/issues?assignee_username=byteblaze`. However, the page still looks like it's showing the Projects view. Let me wait a moment for the page to load or take another screenshot to see if it has updated.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'duration': 1000}

[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I'm now on the Issues page and I can see several issues. I can see two issues with "better" in their titles:

1. "Better initial load experience" - created 8 years ago by Byte Blaze
2. "Better sharing solution" - created 8 years ago by Byte Blaze

However, I need to find the **latest created** issue with "better" in its title. The current view is showing issues filtered by assignee "Byte Blaze" and sorted by "Updated date". I need to:
1. Remove the assignee filter to see ALL issues I created
2. Sort by creation date to find the latest created issue

Let me first check if I need to view issues I **created** rather than issues **assigned** to me. The task says "my latest created issue", so I should look for issues created by me. Let me change the filter.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'X button next to "Byte Blaze" in the Assignee filter'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! The assignee filter has been removed. Now I can see there's a search box that says "Search or filter results...". Now I need to:

1. Search for issues with "better" in the title
2. Filter to show only issues I created (author filter)
3. Sort by creation date to find the latest one

Let me first add a filter to show only issues created by me, then search for "better". Let me click in the search box and add filters.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'Search or filter results text input field'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! A dropdown menu has appeared with filter options including "Author", "Assignee", "Milestone", "Release", "Label", and "My-Reaction". I need to click on "Author" to filter by issues I created.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'Author option in the dropdown menu'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I can see a dropdown has appeared with options "=" , "is", and "is not". I need to select "=" or "is" and then type my username (Byte Blaze). Let me click on "=" to select that option.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': '= option in the dropdown'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! A dropdown list of users has appeared. I can see "Byte Blaze" at the top of the list. Let me click on it to select it as the author filter.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'Byte Blaze option at the top of the user dropdown list'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! I've filtered the issues to show only those authored by Byte Blaze. Now I can see the filter shows "Author = Byte Blaze". Now I need to search for issues with "better" in the title. I can see there are already two issues visible with "better" in their titles:

1. "Better initial load experience" - created 8 years ago
2. "Better sharing solution" - created 8 years ago

However, I need to make sure I'm seeing all issues with "better" in the title and need to find the **latest created** one. Let me add a search term to filter for "better". I'll click in the search box area after the author filter and type "better".
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'search input area after the Byte Blaze filter tag'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The dropdown menu has appeared again. I need to close this and just type "better" in the search box. Let me press Escape to close this dropdown and then type the search term.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'keys': ['escape']}
[result] Keys pressed successfully
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'content': 'better', 'pressEnterAfterType': True}
[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I can see the search filter now shows "Author = Byte Blaze" and "better" as search terms. The page is loading (I can see the loading icon). Let me wait for it to load and then take a screenshot to see the filtered results.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'duration': 1500}
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608'}
[result] Finished waiting for 1500ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! The search has filtered the results and I can now see there are 3 issues with "better" in their titles created by Byte Blaze:

1. "Better initial load experience" - created 8 years ago by Byte Blaze
2. "Better sharing solution" - created 8 years ago by Byte Blaze
3. "Set up environment variables" - created 5 years ago by Byte Blaze (This one doesn't have "better" in the title, so it might be in the description)

I can see at the top it shows:
- Open: 3
- Closed: 5
- All: 8

Currently I'm viewing the "Open" tab which shows 3 open issues. However, I need to find the **latest created** issue with "better" in its title. The current view is sorted by "Updated date". I need to change the sort to "Created date" to find the latest created one.

But first, let me check if there are any closed issues with "better" in the title that might be newer. Let me click on "All" to see all issues (both open and closed).
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'All tab showing 8 issues'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the page is loading. Let me wait for it to complete and take another screenshot.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'duration': 1500}
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608'}
[result] Finished waiting for 1500ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! Now I can see all issues (both open and closed) with "better" in the title. I can see several issues with "better" in their titles:

**Open issues:**
1. "Better initial load experience" - created 8 years ago
2. "Better sharing solution" - created 8 years ago

**Closed issues:**
3. "Add better form validation for our newsletter and contact pages" - created 5 years ago - **CLOSED**
4. "Better Event page UX" - created 7 years ago - **CLOSED**

Now I need to sort by creation date to find the **latest created** issue. The current sort is by "Updated date". Let me click on the sort dropdown to change it to "Created date".
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'Updated date dropdown button'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! A dropdown menu has appeared with various sort options. I can see:
- Priority
- Created date
- Closed date
- Updated date (currently selected with a checkmark)
- Milestone due date
- Due date
- Popularity
- Label priority
- Manual
- Title

I need to click on "Created date" to sort by when the issues were created.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'Created date option in the sort dropdown menu'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I can see the sort has been changed to "Created date" (the dropdown now shows "Created date" instead of "Updated date"). The page is loading. Let me wait for it to complete and see the results sorted by creation date.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'duration': 1500}
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608'}
[result] Finished waiting for 1500ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now the issues are sorted by "Created date". Looking at the list from newest to oldest (the list appears to be sorted from oldest to newest based on the current view), I can see the issues with "better" in their titles:

From the current view (sorted by created date), the issues with "better" in the title are:

1. "Better Event page UX" - created 7 years ago - **CLOSED**
2. "Better initial load experience" - created 8 years ago - (appears to be Open based on no "CLOSED" label)
3. "Better sharing solution" - created 8 years ago - (appears to be Open based on no "CLOSED" label)

And earlier in the list:
4. "Add better form validation for our newsletter and contact pages" - created 5 years ago - **CLOSED**

Wait, I need to check the sort order. Let me look at the sort arrow. I can see there's a sort icon next to "Created date". The list appears to be showing older items at the bottom and newer at the top. So "Add better form validation for our newsletter and contact pages" created 5 years ago would be the **latest created** issue with "better" in its title.

Let me click on this issue to check if it's closed.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'Add better form validation for our newsletter and contact pages issue title'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the page is loading. Let me wait for it to complete.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'duration': 2000}
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608'}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I've successfully navigated to the issue page. I can now clearly see the issue details:

**Title:** "Add better form validation for our newsletter and contact pages"

**Status:** At the top of the page, I can see a blue badge that says "**Closed**" 

**Created:** 5 years ago by Byte Blaze

This is indeed the latest created issue with "better" in its title (created 5 years ago, which is more recent than the other "better" issues that were created 7-8 years ago).

The issue is **CLOSED**.
[tool] mcp__task-completion__complete_task: {'finalAnswer': 'Yes, the issue is closed'}

I\'ve filtered the issues to show only those authored by Byte Blaze. Now I can see the filter shows "Author = Byte Blaze". Now I need to search for issues with "better" in the title. I can see there are already two issues visible with "better" in their titles:\n\n1. "Better initial load experience" - created 8 years ago\n2. "Better sharing solution" - created 8 years ago\n\nHowever, I need to make sure I\'m seeing all issues with "better" in the title and need to find the **latest created** one. Let me add a search term to filter for "better". I\'ll click in the search box area after the author filter and type "better".\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'target\': \'search input area after the Byte Blaze filter tag\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nThe dropdown menu has appeared again.

"Better initial load experience" - created 8 years ago by Byte Blaze\n2. "Better sharing solution" - created 8 years ago by Byte Blaze\n3. "Set up environment variables" - created 5 years ago by Byte Blaze (This one doesn\'t have "better" in the title, so it might be in the description)\n\nI can see at the top it shows:\n- Open: 3\n- Closed: 5\n- All: 8\n\nCurrently I\'m viewing the "Open" tab which shows 3 open issues. However, I need to find the **latest created** issue with "better" in its title. The current view is sorted by "Updated date". I need to change the sort to "Created date" to find the latest created one.\n\nBut first, let me check if there are any closed issues with "better" in the title that might be newer. Let me click on "All" to see all issues (both open and closed).\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'target\': \'All tab showing 8 issues\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI can see the page is loading.

Now I can see all issues (both open and closed) with "better" in the title. I can see several issues with "better" in their titles:\n\n**Open issues:**\n1. "Better initial load experience" - created 8 years ago\n2. "Better sharing solution" - created 8 years ago\n\n**Closed issues:**\n3. "Add better form validation for our newsletter and contact pages" - created 5 years ago - **CLOSED**\n4. "Better Event page UX" - created 7 years ago - **CLOSED**\n\nNow I need to sort by creation date to find the **latest created** issue. The current sort is by "Updated date". Let me click on the sort dropdown to change it to "Created date".\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'target\': \'Updated date dropdown button\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect!

I can see:\n- Priority\n- Created date\n- Closed date\n- Updated date (currently selected with a checkmark)\n- Milestone due date\n- Due date\n- Popularity\n- Label priority\n- Manual\n- Title\n\nI need to click on "Created date" to sort by when the issues were created.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'target\': \'Created date option in the sort dropdown menu\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood! I can see the sort has been changed to "Created date" (the dropdown now shows "Created date" instead of "Updated date"). The page is loading. Let me wait for it to complete and see the results sorted by creation date.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'duration\': 1500}\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\'}\n[result] Finished waiting for 1500ms. {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\n[result] {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect! Now the issues are sorted by "Created date". Looking at the list from newest to oldest (the list appears to be sorted from oldest to newest based on the current view), I can see the issues with "better" in their titles:\n\nFrom the current view (sorted by created date), the issues with "better" in the title are:\n\n1. "Better Event page UX" - created 7 years ago - **CLOSED**\n2. "Better initial load experience" - created 8 years ago - (appears to be Open based on no "CLOSED" label)\n3. "Better sharing solution" - created 8 years ago - (appears to be Open based on no "CLOSED" label)\n\nAnd earlier in the list:\n4. "Add better form validation for our newsletter and contact pages" - created 5 years ago - **CLOSED**\n\nWait, I need to check the sort order. Let me look at the sort arrow. I can see there\'s a sort icon next to "Created date". The list appears to be showing older items at the bottom and newer at the top. So "Add better form validation for our newsletter and contact pages" created 5 years ago would be the **latest created** issue with "better" in its title.\n\nLet me click on this issue to check if it\'s closed.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'target\': \'Add better form validation for our newsletter and contact pages issue title\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI can see the page is loading.
