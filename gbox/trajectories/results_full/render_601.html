I can see there's a Postmill tab (which appears to be a Reddit-like test website). Let me switch to that tab and take a screenshot.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__switch_tab: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'tabId': '2'}
[result] Switched to tab 2 successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I'm now on Postmill, which is a Reddit-like test website. I can see:
- The user is logged in as "MarvelsGrantMan136"
- There's a "+ Submit" button in the top navigation
- There's a "Forums" link to browse forums/subreddits
- The page shows "You are not subscribed to any forum. Showing featured forums instead."

To post the question "is car necessary in NYC" in an appropriate subreddit, I need to:
1. First, find a suitable subreddit (forum) - likely something related to NYC, AskReddit, or city living
2. Then create a post with the question

Let me click on "Forums" to see what subreddits are available.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': 'Forums link in the top red navigation bar'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The page appears to be loading but shows the same content. The URL has changed to "/forums" but I don't see a list of forums yet. Let me wait a moment for the page to fully load.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! Now I can see the list of forums. I can see several options:
- /r/AskReddit (10,041 submissions) - This is perfect for general questions
- /r/relationship_advice
- /r/worldnews
- /r/news
- /r/movies
- /r/memes
- /r/wallstreetbets
- /r/gaming

For the question "is car necessary in NYC", **AskReddit** is the most appropriate subreddit as it's designed for general questions where people can share their experiences and opinions. Let me scroll down to see if there's a more specific NYC-related subreddit, but AskReddit would be a great choice.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see more forums now. I don't see a specific NYC subreddit yet. Let me continue scrolling to check if there's one.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see we're at the bottom of the first page, and there's pagination (pages 1, 2, 3, 4, Next). I haven't seen a specific NYC subreddit yet. Let me check the next page to see if there's a more specific location-based subreddit, but AskReddit would still be a very appropriate place for this question.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': 'Next button at the bottom of the page'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The page doesn't seem to have changed. Let me scroll back up to the top and use the search functionality to look for NYC-related subreddits. If there isn't one, I'll use AskReddit which is perfect for this type of question.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'long'}
[result] Scrolled up by long distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Let me scroll back to the top to access the search bar and search for NYC-related subreddits.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'long'}
[result] Scrolled up by long distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good, I'm back at the top. Now let me use the search bar at the top of the page to search for NYC-related forums. Let me click on the search icon.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled up by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I can see the search bar in the top navigation. Let me click on it to search for NYC-related forums.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': 'Search icon in the red navigation bar'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Great! The search box is now active (I can see it's expanded with a white background). Let me type "NYC" to search for NYC-related forums.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'content': 'NYC', 'pressEnterAfterType': True}
[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the search has been executed (the page is loading - there's a loading indicator in the tab). Let me wait for the results to load.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
It seems the search didn't navigate to a new page - it still shows the same list of forums. The search functionality might work differently. Since there doesn't appear to be a specific NYC subreddit in this test environment, I'll proceed with **AskReddit**, which is the most appropriate forum for this type of general question where people share their experiences and opinions.

Let me click on the AskReddit link to go to that subreddit.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': 'AskReddit link in the forum list'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The page is loading (I can see the URL at the bottom shows "ec2-3-149-78-74.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/AskReddit"). Let me wait for it to load.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
It seems like the page navigation didn't work as expected - I'm still on the forums list. Let me try clicking directly on the "/r/AskReddit" text (the red link) instead.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': '/r/AskReddit red link text at the top of the AskReddit forum entry'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I'm now on the AskReddit subreddit page. I can see:
- The URL shows: ec2-3-149-78-74.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/AskReddit
- The page shows "/r/AskReddit" at the top
- There are existing posts showing various questions
- There's a "+ Submit" button in the top navigation bar

Now I need to create a new post with the question "is car necessary in NYC". Let me click on the "+ Submit" button to create a new post.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': '+ Submit button in the red navigation bar at the top'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Great! I can see the page is loading the submission form. The tab title shows "Create submission" and the URL shows "submit/AskReddit". Let me wait for the form to fully load.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! The submission form has loaded. I can see:
- A "Create submission" heading
- Two tabs: "URL" and "Image" (URL is currently selected)
- A URL field (optional)
- A "Title" field (required - marked with *)
- A "Body" field (optional text area)
- A "Forum" dropdown showing "AskReddit" (already selected)
- A red "Create submission" button

For this task, I need to post the question "is car necessary in NYC" as the title. Since it's a question post, I don't need to fill in the URL field. Let me click on the Title field and enter the question.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': 'Title text input field'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! The Title field is now focused (I can see the red border around it). Now let me type the question "is car necessary in NYC".
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'content': 'is car necessary in NYC', 'pressEnterAfterType': False}
[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! The question "is car necessary in NYC" has been entered in the Title field. I can see:
- The title field now contains: "is car necessary in NYC"
- The Forum is set to "AskReddit"
- The red "Create submission" button is ready to be clicked

Now I need to click the "Create submission" button to post the question.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': 'Create submission red button'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! I can see the submission is being processed. Notice:
- The tab title has changed to "is car necessary in NYC"
- The URL has changed to: ec2-3-149-78-74.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/AskReddit/20/is-car-necessary-in-nyc

This indicates the post has been created! The URL shows it's post #20 in the AskReddit forum with the slug "is-car-necessary-in-nyc". Let me wait a moment for the page to fully load and then verify the post was successfully created.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'duration': 2000}

Perfect! The post has been successfully created! I can see:

The search functionality might work differently. Since there doesn\'t appear to be a specific NYC subreddit in this test environment, I\'ll proceed with **AskReddit**, which is the most appropriate forum for this type of general question where people share their experiences and opinions.\n\nLet me click on the AskReddit link to go to that subreddit.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502\', \'target\': \'AskReddit link in the forum list\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nThe page is loading (I can see the URL at the bottom shows "ec2-3-149-78-74.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/f/AskReddit").
