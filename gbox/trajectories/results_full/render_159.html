Perfect! I can see search results for Nintendo Switch game card storage. I can see several storage options displayed. Let me examine these products to find the best one that can hold 31 cards. I can see:

1. Game Card Holder Storage Case for Nintendo Switch Games or PS Vita - $11.99
2. Game Cartridge Holder Case for 160 Nintendo 3DS games (looks like it holds many cards)
3. HEIYING Game Card Case for Nintendo Switch (mentions 24 cards)
4. Nintendo 2020 Newest - Mario Kart Live

Let me scroll down to see more options and get more details about each product's capacity.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see more products now. I notice there's a "Mijibisu Car Headrest Mount Holder for Nintendo Switch, Carrying Case Fits Original AC Adapter Charger for Nintendo Switch with 10 Game Card Slots" which mentions 10 game card slots - that's not enough for 31 cards.

Let me scroll back up to look at those first products more carefully, especially the one that mentioned holding many cards (the 160 Nintendo 3DS one looked promising).
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled up by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! Now I can see the products clearly. Let me examine these options:

1. **Game Card Holder Storage Case for Nintendo Switch Games or PS Vita Game Case or SD Memory Cards, Black** - $11.99
2. **Game Cartridge Holder Case for 160 Nintendo 3DS 3DSXL 2DS 2DSXL DS DSi, Storage Organizer Compatible with Nintendo Switch Game, Sony PS Vita Games, Playstation Vita Memory Card and SD Cards (Box Only)** - $16.99
3. **HEIYING Game Card Case for Nintendo Switch& Switch OLED Game Card or Micro SD Memory Cards,Portable Switch Game Memory Card Storage with 24 Game Card Slots and 24 Micro SD Card Slots. (Black)** - $14.69

The second one mentions 160 slots which would easily fit 31 cards. Let me click on it to get more details.

Excellent! The page has loaded. I can see:

**Game Cartridge Holder Case for 160 Nintendo 3DS 3DSXL 2DS 2DSXL DS DSi, Storage Organizer Compatible with Nintendo Switch Game, Sony PS Vita Games, Playstation Vita Memory Card and SD Cards (Box Only)**

- Price: $16.99
- IN STOCK
- Holds 160 game cards

This can hold 160 cards, which is way more than the 31 cards needed. However, let me scroll down to check if there are other options that might be more appropriate in size (closer to 31 cards) and potentially cheaper. Let me also check for any other details about this product.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I can see the product description which confirms this is a "Large Capacity Game Cartridge Storage Case" designed for Nintendo Switch game holder. Let me continue scrolling to see more details about the capacity and features.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good, I can see more details about this storage case. Let me continue scrolling to see if there are specifications about the exact capacity and any comparison with other options.

[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I can see the case has:
- Removable sponge inner support
- High-quality materials to protect cards
- Large storage space to meet daily needs
- Portable design
- Sturdy hand strap

This case holds 160 cards which is more than enough for 31 cards. However, let me go back to the search results to compare with other options to find the best fit. The HEIYING case I saw earlier mentioned 24 card slots, which wouldn't be enough for 31 cards. Let me navigate back to see if there are other options with a capacity between 31-160 cards that might be more cost-effective or better suited.

Good, I'm back at the search results. Let me examine the first product more carefully - the "Game Card Holder Storage Case for Nintendo Switch Games or PS Vita Game Case or SD Memory Cards, Black" at $11.99. Let me click on it to see its capacity.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'Game Card Holder Storage Case for Nintendo Switch Games or PS Vita Game Case or SD Memory Cards, Black'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I can see this product at $11.99. Now let me scroll down to see the exact capacity - I can see in the image it has multiple card slots with what looks like game cards and SD card slots. Let me scroll to see the full specifications.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! I found the key information:

**Capacity: 40 units Nintendo Switch games, SD/SDHC/SDXC memory cards or Sony PS Vita games**

This case holds **40 game cards**, which is more than enough for the 31 cards needed. It's also cheaper at $11.99 compared to the 160-card case at $16.99.

Let me continue scrolling to see if there are any other important details, and then I should check if there are other options with capacities closer to 31 cards.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I can see more details:
- Portable, durable and lightweight
- Made of quality shockproof and waterproof material
- Durable and Lightweight
- Double metal zipper pullers for easily opening and closing
- Different colors to choose freely

This 40-card case at $11.99 seems like a solid option. However, let me go back and check a few more products to make sure I'm finding the best option. Let me look at some other results to see if there's anything between 31-40 cards that might be even better priced or featured.

I can see "Mijibisu Car Headrest Mount Holder for Nintendo Switch, Carrying Case Fits Original AC Adapter Charger for Nintendo Switch with 10 Game Card Slots" at $9.86, which only holds 10 cards - not enough for 31 cards.

Let me continue scrolling to see if there are more storage options with appropriate capacities.

I can see I'm at the bottom of page 1 and there are pagination options (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). The items on this page don't appear to be game card storage cases. Let me check page 2 to see if there are other storage options.

Good, page 2 has loaded. I can see "Items 13-24 of 25279". The items shown don't appear to be specifically game card storage cases. Let me scroll down to see if there are any relevant storage cases on this page.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I don't see any specific game card storage cases on this page. Based on my research so far, I've found the following options that can hold 31+ Nintendo Switch game cards:

1. **Game Card Holder Storage Case for Nintendo Switch Games** - 40 cards capacity - $11.99
2. **Game Cartridge Holder Case for 160 Nintendo 3DS** (compatible with Switch) - 160 cards capacity - $16.99
3. **HEIYING Game Card Case** - 24 card slots (not enough for 31 cards)

The best option for 31 cards is the **40-card capacity case at $11.99** because:
- It fits exactly 31 cards with room for a few more
- It's the most cost-effective option
- It's portable, durable, lightweight
- Made of shockproof and waterproof material
- Has double metal zipper pullers

The 160-card case would work but is overkill for 31 cards and costs more ($16.99).

Let me navigate back to the 40-card storage case product page so I can provide the final answer with the correct URL.

I notice there\'s a "Mijibisu Car Headrest Mount Holder for Nintendo Switch, Carrying Case Fits Original AC Adapter Charger for Nintendo Switch with 10 Game Card Slots" which mentions 10 game card slots - that\'s not enough for 31 cards.\n\nLet me scroll back up to look at those first products more carefully, especially the one that mentioned holding many cards (the 160 Nintendo 3DS one looked promising).\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'direction\': \'up\', \'distance\': \'medium\'}\n[result] Scrolled up by medium distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood!

However, let me scroll down to check if there are other options that might be more appropriate in size (closer to 31 cards) and potentially cheaper. Let me also check for any other details about this product.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'direction\': \'down\', \'distance\': \'medium\'}\n[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood!

However, let me go back to the search results to compare with other options to find the best fit. The HEIYING case I saw earlier mentioned 24 card slots, which wouldn\'t be enough for 31 cards. Let me navigate back to see if there are other options with a capacity between 31-160 cards that might be more cost-effective or better suited.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'keys\': [\'alt\', \'arrowLeft\']}\n[result] Keys pressed successfully\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'duration\': 2000}\n[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood, I\'m back at the search results.
