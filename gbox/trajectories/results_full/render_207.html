Good! I can see I'm on a GitLab page for the "a11yproject.com" project. I can see it has 2,320 commits. To find commits made by Eric and Kilian on 1/3/2023, I need to navigate to the commits section. Let me click on the commits count link.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': '2,320 Commits link in the repository statistics bar'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the page is loading (there's a loading indicator in the tab). Let me wait a moment for it to load completely, then take a screenshot.

[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I'm now on the commits page. I can see commits grouped by dates in March 2023, February 2023, etc. I need to find commits from January 3, 2023 (1/3/2023). Let me scroll down to find January 2023 commits.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I'm now seeing February 2023 commits and I can see "18 Jan, 2023 3 commits" at the bottom. I need to continue scrolling to find January 3, 2023. Let me scroll down more.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! I can see commits from January 2023. I can see:
- 15 Jan, 2023: 3 commits
- 05 Jan, 2023: 6 commits  
- 04 Jan, 2023: 2 commits
- 03 Jan, 2023: 1 commit

I can see "03 Jan, 2023 1 commit" at the bottom. Let me scroll down a bit more to see all the commits from January 3, 2023.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'short'}
[result] Scrolled down by short distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I can now see the commits from January 3, 2023:
- "03 Jan, 2023 1 commit"
- Under that date, I can see one commit: "Add resource (#1496)" by Eric Bailey

So far I can see only 1 commit from Eric Bailey on January 3, 2023. However, the heading says "03 Jan, 2023 1 commit", which suggests there's only 1 commit total on that date. But I need to check if there are any commits by Kilian on that date. Let me scroll up a bit to see if I missed anything, or check if the display is showing all commits for that date.

Actually, looking more carefully at the page, I notice that GitLab groups commits by date and shows a count. The "03 Jan, 2023 1 commit" heading indicates there's only 1 commit on that date in total, which is the one by Eric Bailey that I can see.

However, I should verify this by using the Author filter to specifically search for commits by Eric and Kilian. Let me click on the "Author" dropdown to filter by author.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'long'}
[result] Scrolled up by long distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see various commits from January 2023. I need to scroll back to the top to access the Author filter dropdown to search specifically for commits by Eric and Kilian on 1/3/2023. Let me scroll to the top.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'long'}
[result] Scrolled up by long distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good, I'm back in the February 2023 area. Let me continue scrolling up to get to the top of the page where the filter controls are.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'long'}
[result] Scrolled up by long distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I can see the filter controls at the top. I can see the "Author" dropdown button. Let me use a different approach - instead of filtering, let me use the "Contributors" link in the sidebar to see all contributors and their commit counts, or I can navigate directly to check commits for specific dates.

Actually, let me try a more efficient approach. I'll click on "Graph" in the sidebar to see if there's a visual representation that might help, or better yet, let me search for commits by using the search functionality. But first, let me try clicking on the "Author" dropdown to filter by specific authors.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Author dropdown button in the filter bar'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Great! The Author dropdown is now open. I can see several authors listed:
- Byte Blaze (byteblaze)
- Roshan Jossy (Roshanjossey)
- The A11Y Project (a11yproject)

I need to scroll down in this dropdown to find "Eric" and "Kilian". Let me type in the search box to search for these names. Let me first search for "Eric".
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'content': 'Eric'}
[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I see the page is loading. Let me wait a moment and then take a screenshot to see if the search results have filtered the authors.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'duration': 1500}
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86'}
[result] Finished waiting for 1500ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Oh no! It looks like typing "Eric" triggered a search in the GitLab global search bar instead of filtering the author dropdown, and now I'm on a "New Issue" page. Let me go back to the commits page. I'll use the browser back button.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'keys': ['alt', 'arrowLeft']}
[result] Keys pressed successfully

[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I'm back on the commits page and the Author dropdown is still open. I can see some authors listed. Let me scroll down within this dropdown to see more authors and find "Eric" and "Kilian". Let me click somewhere else first to close this dropdown and try a different approach.

Let me use the "Contributors" link in the sidebar instead, which might give me a better view of all contributors. Let me close this dropdown first by pressing Escape.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'keys': ['escape']}
[result] Keys pressed successfully
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86'}
[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The dropdown is still open. Looking at the commits visible on the page, I can see many commits by "Eric Bailey". I also saw earlier that there was a commit by "Kilian Valkhof" on 05 Mar, 2023. Let me try a different approach - instead of using filters, let me directly check the commit history by looking at what I already saw.

From my earlier scrolling, I saw:
- On January 3, 2023: There was "03 Jan, 2023 1 commit" which showed "Add resource (#1496)" by Eric Bailey

So based on what I've already observed, it appears there was only 1 commit on January 3, 2023, made by Eric Bailey. However, I should verify if there were any commits by Kilian on that date. Let me close this dropdown and scroll back down to the January 3, 2023 section to carefully check.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Any Author option in the author filter dropdown'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! The dropdown is closed now. I can see the page is loading (loading icon in tab). Now let me scroll down to the January 3, 2023 section to verify the commits on that date. I can see on this page there's a commit by "Kilian Valkhof" on 05 Mar, 2023. Let me scroll down to find the January 3, 2023 commits.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'long'}
[result] Scrolled down by long distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I can see "18 Jan, 2023 3 commits" at the bottom. Let me continue scrolling down to reach January 3, 2023.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I can now see the January 3, 2023 section at the bottom: "03 Jan, 2023 1 commit". Let me scroll down just a bit more to see the complete commit information for that date.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'short'}
[result] Scrolled down by short distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I can clearly see the commits for January 3, 2023:

**03 Jan, 2023 1 commit**
- "Add resource (#1496)" by Eric Bailey

The heading clearly states "1 commit" on that date, and I can see only one commit listed: by Eric Bailey.

I need to verify if there are any commits by someone named "Kilian" on that date. Looking at the commit list, I can see the author is "Eric Bailey" for the January 3, 2023 commit. 

However, I noticed earlier there was a commit by "Kilian Valkhof" on a different date (March 5, 2023). Let me check if the task is asking about people named "Eric" and "Kilian" specifically. The task asked: "How many commits did Eric and Kilian make on 1/3/2023 in total?"

Based on what I can see:
- Eric Bailey made 1 commit on January 3, 2023
- There is no commit by anyone named Kilian on January 3, 2023 (the heading says "1 commit" total for that date)

However, to be thorough, let me check if "Eric" refers to "Eric Bailey" and verify there are no other contributors named Eric or Kilian who might have committed on that date. Let me click on the "Contributors" link in the sidebar to see all contributors to this repository.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Contributors link in the left sidebar'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the Contributors link is now highlighted in the sidebar. The page is loading (I can see the URL in the status bar at the bottom shows it's going to the graphs/main page). Let me wait for it to load.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'duration': 2000}

Excellent! The Contributors page has loaded. I can now see the contributors to this repository:

1. **Eric Bailey** - 422 commits (eric.w.bailey@gmail.com)
2. **Eric Bailey** - 410 commits (ericwbailey@users.noreply.github.com) 
3. **Dave Rupert** - 87 commits
4. **Scott Vinkle** - 64 commits

I can see there are two "Eric Bailey" entries (likely the same person with different email addresses), but I don't see anyone named "Kilian" in the visible contributors. Let me scroll down to see if there are more contributors.

Perfect! I found **Kilian Valkhof**! 

I can see:
- **Kilian Valkhof** - 3 commits (kilian@kilianvalkhof.com)

The contributor page shows that Kilian Valkhof has made 3 commits total to this repository. However, this doesn't tell me specifically how many commits were made on January 3, 2023.

Now I need to go back to the commits page and check specifically what commits Kilian made on January 3, 2023. Earlier, I saw that on January 3, 2023, there was only "1 commit" total (by Eric Bailey). But let me verify this by checking if Kilian made any commits on that specific date.

Let me go back to the Commits page to check the specific date. Let me click on "Commits" in the sidebar.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Commits link in the left sidebar'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! The Commits link is highlighted and the page is loading (I can see the URL at the bottom). Let me wait for it to load.

[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I'm back on the commits page. I can see there's a commit by "Kilian Valkhof" on "05 Mar, 2023" (visible in the list: "Fix typos in the code examples (#1524)"). Now I need to scroll down to January 3, 2023 to verify exactly what commits were made on that date. Let me scroll down to that section.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'long'}
[result] Scrolled down by long distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good, I can see "18 Jan, 2023 3 commits" at the bottom. Let me continue scrolling to reach January 3, 2023.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good, I can see:
- 15 Jan, 2023: 3 commits
- 05 Jan, 2023: 6 commits

Let me continue scrolling down to see January 3, 2023.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I can clearly see the **January 3, 2023** section:

**03 Jan, 2023 1 commit**
- "Add resource (#1496)" by Eric Bailey

The heading clearly states "**1 commit**" for January 3, 2023, and I can see only one commit listed under that date, which is by **Eric Bailey**.

Based on my thorough investigation:
- **Eric (Eric Bailey)** made **1 commit** on January 3, 2023
- **Kilian (Kilian Valkhof)** made **0 commits** on January 3, 2023 (his commits were on other dates, like March 5, 2023)

**Total commits on January 3, 2023: 1 + 0 = 1**
[tool] mcp__task-completion__complete_task: {'finalAnswer': '1'}
[complete] 1
Task completed! I found that Eric and Kilian made a total of **1 commit** on January 3, 2023 (1/3/2023):
- Eric Bailey: 1 commit
- Kilian Valkhof: 0 commits

The answer is **1**.</pre></div><div class='action_object' style='background-color:grey'><pre>{'action_type': <ActionTypes.STOP: 17>, 'coords': array([0., 0.], dtype=float32), 'element_role': 0, 'element_name': '', 'text': [], 'page_number': 0, 'url': '', 'nth': 0, 'pw_code': '', 'element_id': '', 'key_comb': '', 'direction': '', 'answer': '1', 'raw_prediction': 'I\'ll help you find out how many commits Eric and Kilian made on 1/3/2023 in total.

I can now see the commits from January 3, 2023:\n- "03 Jan, 2023 1 commit"\n- Under that date, I can see one commit: "Add resource (#1496)" by Eric Bailey\n\nSo far I can see only 1 commit from Eric Bailey on January 3, 2023. However, the heading says "03 Jan, 2023 1 commit", which suggests there\'s only 1 commit total on that date. But I need to check if there are any commits by Kilian on that date. Let me scroll up a bit to see if I missed anything, or check if the display is showing all commits for that date.\n\nActually, looking more carefully at the page, I notice that GitLab groups commits by date and shows a count. The "03 Jan, 2023 1 commit" heading indicates there\'s only 1 commit on that date in total, which is the one by Eric Bailey that I can see.\n\nHowever, I should verify this by using the Author filter to specifically search for commits by Eric and Kilian. Let me click on the "Author" dropdown to filter by author.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'direction\': \'up\', \'distance\': \'long\'}\n[result] Scrolled up by long distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI can see various commits from January 2023.

Let me continue scrolling up to get to the top of the page where the filter controls are.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'direction\': \'up\', \'distance\': \'long\'}\n[result] Scrolled up by long distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect! Now I can see the filter controls at the top. I can see the "Author" dropdown button. Let me use a different approach - instead of filtering, let me use the "Contributors" link in the sidebar to see all contributors and their commit counts, or I can navigate directly to check commits for specific dates.\n\nActually, let me try a more efficient approach. I\'ll click on "Graph" in the sidebar to see if there\'s a visual representation that might help, or better yet, let me search for commits by using the search functionality. But first, let me try clicking on the "Author" dropdown to filter by specific authors.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'target\': \'Author dropdown button in the filter bar\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGreat!

I can see several authors listed:\n- Byte Blaze (byteblaze)\n- Roshan Jossy (Roshanjossey)\n- The A11Y Project (a11yproject)\n\nI need to scroll down in this dropdown to find "Eric" and "Kilian". Let me type in the search box to search for these names. Let me first search for "Eric".\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'content\': \'Eric\'}\n[result] Text typed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI see the page is loading.

It looks like typing "Eric" triggered a search in the GitLab global search bar instead of filtering the author dropdown, and now I\'m on a "New Issue" page. Let me go back to the commits page. I\'ll use the browser back button.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'keys\': [\'alt\', \'arrowLeft\']}\n[result] Keys pressed successfully\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'duration\': 1500}\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\'}\n[result] Finished waiting for 1500ms. {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\n[result] {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood! I\'m back on the commits page and the Author dropdown is still open. I can see some authors listed. Let me scroll down within this dropdown to see more authors and find "Eric" and "Kilian". Let me click somewhere else first to close this dropdown and try a different approach.\n\nLet me use the "Contributors" link in the sidebar instead, which might give me a better view of all contributors. Let me close this dropdown first by pressing Escape.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'keys\': [\'escape\']}\n[result] Keys pressed successfully\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\'}\n[result] {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nThe dropdown is still open. Looking at the commits visible on the page, I can see many commits by "Eric Bailey". I also saw earlier that there was a commit by "Kilian Valkhof" on 05 Mar, 2023. Let me try a different approach - instead of using filters, let me directly check the commit history by looking at what I already saw.\n\nFrom my earlier scrolling, I saw:\n- On January 3, 2023: There was "03 Jan, 2023 1 commit" which showed "Add resource (#1496)" by Eric Bailey\n\nSo based on what I\'ve already observed, it appears there was only 1 commit on January 3, 2023, made by Eric Bailey. However, I should verify if there were any commits by Kilian on that date. Let me close this dropdown and scroll back down to the January 3, 2023 section to carefully check.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'target\': \'Any Author option in the author filter dropdown\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood!

I can see on this page there\'s a commit by "Kilian Valkhof" on 05 Mar, 2023.

Looking at the commit list, I can see the author is "Eric Bailey" for the January 3, 2023 commit. \n\nHowever, I noticed earlier there was a commit by "Kilian Valkhof" on a different date (March 5, 2023). Let me check if the task is asking about people named "Eric" and "Kilian" specifically. The task asked: "How many commits did Eric and Kilian make on 1/3/2023 in total?"\n\nBased on what I can see:\n- Eric Bailey made 1 commit on January 3, 2023\n- There is no commit by anyone named Kilian on January 3, 2023 (the heading says "1 commit" total for that date)\n\nHowever, to be thorough, let me check if "Eric" refers to "Eric Bailey" and verify there are no other contributors named Eric or Kilian who might have committed on that date.

I found **Kilian Valkhof**! \n\nI can see:\n- **Kilian Valkhof** - 3 commits (kilian@kilianvalkhof.com)\n\nThe contributor page shows that Kilian Valkhof has made 3 commits total to this repository. However, this doesn\'t tell me specifically how many commits were made on January 3, 2023.\n\nNow I need to go back to the commits page and check specifically what commits Kilian made on January 3, 2023. Earlier, I saw that on January 3, 2023, there was only "1 commit" total (by Eric Bailey). But let me verify this by checking if Kilian made any commits on that specific date.\n\nLet me go back to the Commits page to check the specific date. Let me click on "Commits" in the sidebar.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'target\': \'Commits link in the left sidebar\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood!

I\'m back on the commits page. I can see there\'s a commit by "Kilian Valkhof" on "05 Mar, 2023" (visible in the list: "Fix typos in the code examples (#1524)"). Now I need to scroll down to January 3, 2023 to verify exactly what commits were made on that date. Let me scroll down to that section.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'direction\': \'down\', \'distance\': \'long\'}\n[result] Scrolled down by long distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood, I can see "18 Jan, 2023 3 commits" at the bottom.

Now I can clearly see the **January 3, 2023** section:\n\n**03 Jan, 2023 1 commit**\n- "Add resource (#1496)" by Eric Bailey\n\nThe heading clearly states "**1 commit**" for January 3, 2023, and I can see only one commit listed under that date, which is by **Eric Bailey**.\n\nBased on my thorough investigation:\n- **Eric (Eric Bailey)** made **1 commit** on January 3, 2023\n- **Kilian (Kilian Valkhof)** made **0 commits** on January 3, 2023 (his commits were on other dates, like March 5, 2023)\n\n**Total commits on January 3, 2023: 1 + 0 = 1**\n[tool] mcp__task-completion__complete_task: {\'finalAnswer\': \'1\'}\n[complete] 1\nTask completed! I found that Eric and Kilian made a total of **1 commit** on January 3, 2023 (1/3/2023):\n- Eric Bailey: 1 commit\n- Kilian Valkhof: 0 commits\n\nThe answer is **1**.'}</pre></div><div class='parsed_action' style='background-color:yellow'><pre>stop [1]</pre></div></div>
