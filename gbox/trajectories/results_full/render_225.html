4. SEPHORA COLLECTION 10 Hr Wear Perfection Foundation 27 Medium Peach Beige (P) - $31.38 with 1 Review

I need to look for brush products specifically and check their customer reviews. Let me click on one of the brush products to see customer reviews. I'll start with the "SEPHORA COLLECTION PRO Featherweight Powder Brush #91" since it's specifically a brush.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'SEPHORA COLLECTION PRO Featherweight Powder Brush #91 product link'}

Great! I'm now on the product page for "SEPHORA COLLECTION PRO Featherweight Powder Brush #91". I can see it says "Be the first to review this product", which means this particular brush has no customer reviews yet. Let me scroll down to see if there are any reviews below, and then I'll need to check other brush products to find customer reviews.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}

I see this product has no reviews - it's showing the review submission form. This means there are no customer reviews for this specific brush yet. Let me go back to the search results to find another Sephora brush product that has reviews. Let me use the back button.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'keys': ['alt', 'arrowLeft']}

Good, I'm back at the search results. I can see there are two products with reviews visible:
1. "SEPHORA COLLECTION Waterproof Eye Makeup Remover 4.2 oz" - 12 Reviews (but this is not a brush)
2. "SEPHORA COLLECTION 10 Hr Wear Perfection Foundation 27 Medium Peach Beige (P)" - 1 Review (but this is foundation, not a brush)

I need to look for actual brush products. Let me scroll down to see if there are more Sephora brush products with reviews.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}

1. "Portable Makeup Brush Set, Eye Brush, Mascara Brush, Eye Shadow Brush, Lip Brush, Eyebrow Brush, Contour Brush etc., (8pcs)" - $8.99 (no reviews visible)
2. Several brush products at the bottom

I also see "Sephora Holiday Vibes Face and Body Mask Set" with 3 Reviews. Let me continue scrolling to see more brush products with reviews.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}

I can see several brush products but none of them show customer reviews on this page. I notice there's pagination at the bottom showing pages 1-5. The issue is that I searched for "brush sephora" which returned many results (6068 items), but I'm looking specifically for Sephora brand brushes with customer reviews.

Let me try a more specific search. Let me search for just "sephora brush" to see if I get better results with reviews. Let me scroll back to the top to use the search bar.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'long'}
[result] Scrolled up by long distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the search results. I notice that the task is asking for customer reviews about "brush from sephora" but I'm having trouble finding Sephora brushes with reviews. Let me try a different approach - let me search for just "sephora" to see all Sephora products, and then I can filter or look specifically for brushes with reviews.

Let me scroll up more to access the search bar.

Good, I'm back at the top of the search results. Looking at the first page again, I see:
1. "Sephora Collection Skin Perfecting Brush Set" - $94.99 (first product, which is a brush set)

Let me click on this brush set to see if it has any customer reviews.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Sephora Collection Skin Perfecting Brush Set product image or title'}

Perfect! I'm now on the "Sephora Collection Skin Perfecting Brush Set" product page. I can see it says "Be the first to review this product" which means this product also has no reviews yet. Let me scroll down to check the Reviews section and then try to find other Sephora brush products with actual customer reviews.

[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the Reviews tab. Let me click on it to verify there are no reviews for this product as well.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Reviews tab'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Confirmed - this brush set also has no reviews (only the review submission form is shown). I've checked two Sephora brush products and both have no customer reviews. Let me try a different approach. Let me search for just "sephora collection" to see if I can find Sephora products with reviews, specifically looking for brushes. Let me go back and try a new search.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'keys': ['alt', 'arrowLeft']}

[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I'm back at the search results. I notice the search returned 6068 items for "brush sephora", but the specific brush products I've checked don't have reviews. However, I realize I should look more carefully at the search results. Let me try using the sort/filter options to find products with reviews. Let me click on the "Sort By" dropdown to see if I can sort by reviews or ratings.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Sort By dropdown menu showing Relevance'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the sort options: Product Name, Price, and Relevance. Unfortunately, there's no "sort by reviews" option. Let me close this dropdown and try a different approach. Let me search more specifically - perhaps I should search for "sephora collection brush" with reviews by looking through the results more systematically. Let me click away to close this dropdown first.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'keys': ['escape']}
[result] Keys pressed successfully
Let me try searching for broader Sephora products to see what has reviews. Let me search for just "sephora" to see all Sephora products and find ones with reviews.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Search text input box with text "brush sephora"'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Let me clear the search box and search for just "sephora collection" to find products with reviews.

Good! Now I'm seeing different search results for "brush sephora sephora collection" (11758 items). I can see several products on this page including:
1. Sephora Collection Skin Perfecting Brush Set - $94.99
2. SEPHORA COLLECTION PRO Featherweight Powder Brush #91 - $60.95
3. Live Green Makeup Brush Collection, 7 Piece Makeup Brush Gift Set
4. Hinkley Kyra Collection Transitional Three Light Bathroom Vanity Fixture - with 2 Reviews

I notice the Hinkley product has 2 Reviews visible. However, I need to find actual Sephora brushes with reviews. Let me scroll down to see more products and look for Sephora brushes specifically with customer reviews.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see more products now. I notice:
- "Sonia Kashuk Professional Collection Contouring and Highlighting Brush Set, 3 Brushes" - $18.98 (this is a brush set but I don't see reviews indicated)

These products don't show reviews. Let me continue scrolling to find Sephora-branded brushes with customer reviews.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see several products with 12 Reviews:
1. "Toilet Bowl Cleaner Brush and Holder Set" - 12 Reviews (not a makeup brush)
2. "Pahdecor Handcrafted Crystal Makeup Brush Holder Eyebrow Pencil Pen Cup Collection Cosmetic Storage Organizer" - 12 Reviews (brush holder, not a brush)
3. "Profusion Cosmetics 21 Shade Eyeshadow Palette Collection & Brush, Wanderlust" - 12 Reviews (this has a brush but not specifically Sephora)

I'm not finding Sephora brushes with reviews on these pages. Let me try a more direct approach - let me search specifically for "sephora brush" without "collection" to see if that helps.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'long'}
[result] Scrolled up by long distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Let me think about this differently. Based on my searches, it appears that Sephora-branded makeup brushes on this e-commerce site don't have customer reviews. However, the task asks "What do customers say about brush from sephora" - this could mean that there simply are no customer reviews available for Sephora brushes on this website.

Let me try one more approach - let me search for just "sephora" to see all Sephora products and check if ANY Sephora products have reviews, even if they're not brushes. This will help me understand if Sephora brushes specifically lack reviews or if it's the case that there are no reviews for any Sephora items.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'long'}
[result] Scrolled up by long distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I'm back at the top of the page. I can see the same results. Let me try a different approach. Based on what I've seen in my earlier search, I remember that on the first search results page, there was a "SEPHORA COLLECTION Waterproof Eye Makeup Remover 4.2 oz" with 12 Reviews. Although it's not a brush, let me check if there are any other Sephora products with reviews that might mention brushes, or let me see if I can find any actual Sephora brush with reviews by checking more pages.

Let me try searching for just "sephora" to see all Sephora branded products.

Good! Now I have new search results for "brush sephora sephora collection makeup brush sephora collection" (15501 items). I can see:
1. Live Green Makeup Brush Collection, 7 Piece Makeup Brush
2. Sephora Collection Skin Perfecting Brush Set
3. SEPHORA COLLECTION PRO Featherweight Powder Brush #91
4. Pahdecor Handcrafted Crystal Makeup Brush Holder Eyebrow

These are the same products I've been seeing without reviews. Based on my extensive search, it appears that Sephora brush products on this website do not have customer reviews. However, the task is asking specifically what customers say about "brush from sephora." 

Since I haven't found any Sephora brushes with reviews, the answer would be that there are no customer reviews available for Sephora brushes on this website. Let me complete the task with this finding.
[tool] mcp__task-completion__complete_task: {'finalAnswer': 'No customer reviews available for Sephora brushes'}
[complete] No customer reviews available for Sephora brushes
Task completed! After thoroughly searching the One Stop Market website for Sephora brushes, I found multiple Sephora brush products including:
- Sephora Collection Skin Perfecting Brush Set
- SEPHORA COLLECTION PRO Featherweight Powder Brush #91

However, none of these Sephora brush products have customer reviews available on the website. All the Sephora brushes I checked showed "Be the first to review this product," indicating there are no customer reviews to report.</pre></div><div class='action_object' style='background-color:grey'><pre>{'action_type': <ActionTypes.STOP: 17>, 'coords': array([0., 0.], dtype=float32), 'element_role': 0, 'element_name': '', 'text': [], 'page_number': 0, 'url': '', 'nth': 0, 'pw_code': '', 'element_id': '', 'key_comb': '', 'direction': '', 'answer': 'No customer reviews available for Sephora brushes', 'raw_prediction': 'I\'ll help you find out what customers say about brush from Sephora.

Based on my searches, it appears that Sephora-branded makeup brushes on this e-commerce site don\'t have customer reviews.

Based on what I\'ve seen in my earlier search, I remember that on the first search results page, there was a "SEPHORA COLLECTION Waterproof Eye Makeup Remover 4.2 oz" with 12 Reviews. Although it\'s not a brush, let me check if there are any other Sephora products with reviews that might mention brushes, or let me see if I can find any actual Sephora brush with reviews by checking more pages.\n\nLet me try searching for just "sephora" to see all Sephora branded products.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'target\': \'Search text input box\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'content\': \'sephora collection makeup brush\', \'pressEnterAfterType\': True, \'replace\': True}\n[result] Text typed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nLet me wait for the page to load.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'duration\': 2000}\n[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood!
