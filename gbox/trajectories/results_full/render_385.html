Good! I can see I'm on the "One Stop Market" website. I need to find customer reviews for EYZUTAK phone cases. Since this is an e-commerce site, I should search for "EYZUTAK phone cases" in the search bar. Let me click on the search bar and search for this product.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': 'Search box with placeholder text "Search entire store here..."'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good, the search box is now focused. Let me type "EYZUTAK phone case" to search for the product.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'content': 'EYZUTAK phone case', 'pressEnterAfterType': True}
[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the search has been entered. The page is loading (I can see the loading icon in the tab). Let me wait a moment for the search results to load.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! I can see the search results for "EYZUTAK phone case". The page shows "Items 1-12 of 12805" - so there are many results. I can see several phone cases displayed. I need to look for EYZUTAK branded phone cases specifically and check their reviews. Let me scroll down to see more products and look for EYZUTAK brand products.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see more phone case products, but I need to find specifically EYZUTAK branded products. The search returned many results (12805 items), so let me use the category filter on the left to narrow down. Let me scroll back up to see the filters and look for a way to filter by brand or look at the "Related search terms" which shows "EYZUTAK".
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled up by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I can see there's a "Related search terms" section that shows "EYZUTAK" as a link. Let me click on that to filter specifically for EYZUTAK branded products. I can also see the first product is "EYZUTAK Electroplated Magnetic Ring Holder Case..." with 12 Reviews. Let me click on the EYZUTAK link to filter for EYZUTAK products.

[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The page is loading (I can see it's mostly blank and there's a loading indicator in the tab). Let me wait for the page to fully load with the EYZUTAK search results.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'duration': 2000}

Excellent! Now I'm on the product page for the EYZUTAK phone case. I can see it has "12 Reviews" with a 4-star rating. I need to scroll down to the reviews section to read the individual customer reviews and find those who mentioned that the phone cases are "good looking" or have positive comments about the appearance/aesthetics.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I can see there are two tabs: "Details" and "Reviews (12)". I need to click on the "Reviews (12)" tab to see all the customer reviews.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': 'Reviews (12) tab'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! Now I can see the customer reviews. I can already see several reviews that mention appearance/looks:

1. **Lisa Lee** - "Cute but, the ring broke quickly" - The review says "The case is really cute and I've received compliments on it."

2. **MH** - "Gray color is so chic" - The review says "Love the colors gray and rose gold. Very chic. I'm more impressed by the look in person than in the photos."

3. **Diana Alcaraz** - "Not what it looks like" - This review mentions colors don't match, so this is negative about looks.

4. **Evelyn Kurver** - "Read" - This seems negative about quality.

I can see there's a review at the bottom that starts with "beautiful". Let me scroll down to see all the reviews to capture everyone who mentioned positive comments about the appearance/looks.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Great! I can see more reviews now. Let me continue noting customers who mentioned positive things about the looks:

5. **Misba009** - "beautiful" - The review says "the case is beautiful only bad thing is gets oily with hands all the time because it is made of plastic."

6. **Amanda** - "Cute; scratches easily" - The review says "This case looks really nice. I get a lot of compliments."

7. **N Randall** - "Cute but only for a short time" - Mentions "Cute" in the title, though has durability issues.

[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I can see more reviews and there's pagination showing "1 2" which means there are 2 pages of reviews. Let me scroll up a bit to see the review that was cut off, and also note:

10. **Bethany Robertson** - "Exactly as pictured" - The review says "I love this case for several reasons. I got the emerald green and gold. It's really classy and the plastic is very glossy."

I can also see there's a reviewer "Jady" but the review is cut off. Let me scroll up to see that review and also check if I missed the "Pretty!" review details.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'short'}
[result] Scrolled up by short distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}

[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I can see the pagination showing "1 2" and there's a next arrow. Let me click on page "2" to see the remaining reviews.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': 'Page 2 link in pagination'}
[error] Error: 500 Internal server error (HTTP 500)

[result] Scrolled down by short distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I can see the pagination clearly now with "1 2" and a next arrow. Let me click on the number "2" to see the second page of reviews.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'a123c882-09e0-4148-aa86-599720846502', 'target': 'Number 2 in the pagination controls'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I can see I'm now on page 2 (the pagination shows "1 2" with a back arrow). I can see a partial review from Bethany Robertson at the top and N Randall's review. Let me scroll up to see if there are any more reviews on this page that I haven't seen yet.

[result] Scrolled up by long distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}

Perfect! I can now see that I'm on page 2 (pagination shows "1 2" at the bottom). Looking at this page, I can see only 2 reviews:

1. **Bethany Robertson** - "Exactly as pictured" - Already counted from page 1
2. **N Randall** - "Cute but only for a short time" - Already counted from page 1

It appears that page 2 is showing the same last reviews from page 1. This means I've seen all 12 reviews. Let me now compile the list of customer names who mentioned positive things about the appearance/looks of the EYZUTAK phone cases.

Based on my review of all the customer reviews, the customers who mentioned that EYZUTAK phone cases are good looking (using terms like "cute," "beautiful," "pretty," "chic," "classy," "stunning," "nice," or mentioned receiving compliments) are:
