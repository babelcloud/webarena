Let me use the Magento Admin subagent to find out where I can view completed orders.

[result] Based on the documentation, here's exactly where you can find completed orders in Magento Admin:

**Location**: Sales > Operations > Orders

**Description**: 
The Orders grid lists all current orders 
Perfect! Now I know where to go. Let me navigate to Sales > Operations > Orders to find the most recent completed order.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'SALES menu item in the left sidebar'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! The Sales menu has expanded. I can see "Orders" at the top of the menu. Let me click on it.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Orders menu item in the Sales submenu'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the page is loading (notice the loading icon in the tab). Let me wait a moment for the Orders page to fully load.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I'm now on the Orders page. I can see there are currently 10 records found, but I notice there's an "Active filters: Status: Pending" filter applied. All the orders shown have "Pending" status. I need to remove this filter to see ALL orders, including completed ones, so I can find the most recent completed order.

Let me click "Clear all" to remove the Pending filter.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Clear all link in the top right area next to Active filters'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! The filter has been cleared and I can see the page is loading (there's a loading spinner visible in the middle of the table). I still see 10 records found, and all are showing "Pending" status. Let me wait for the page to fully load and then scroll down to see if there are more orders, or I need to use filters to find completed orders specifically.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! Now I can see 308 records found with various statuses. I can see there's one "Complete" order visible:
- Order ID: 000000230, Date: May 19, 2023 8:11:51 AM, Customer: Ava Brown, Status: Complete

However, I need to find the MOST RECENT completed order. The current view shows orders sorted by Purchase Date, but I need to check if there are more recent completed orders. Let me use the Filters to show only "Complete" orders, then sort by date to find the most recent one.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Filters button in the toolbar area'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! The Filters panel has opened. I can see a "Status" field with a dropdown. Let me click on the Status dropdown to select "Complete" status.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Status dropdown field in the filters panel'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! The Status dropdown has opened and I can see various status options including "Complete". Let me click on "Complete" to filter for completed orders.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Complete option in the Status dropdown menu'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I've selected "Complete" in the Status filter. Now I need to click "Apply Filters" to apply this filter and see only completed orders.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Apply Filters button in the bottom right of the filters panel'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I see the filter is now active ("Active filters: Status: Complete"), but the results still show 308 records found and I can see orders with various statuses (Pending, Processing, Canceled, Complete). This seems like the filter didn't apply correctly. Let me scroll down to see if there are completed orders below, or let me try clicking the Filters button again to reapply.

Actually, looking more carefully at the visible orders, I can see one "Complete" order:
- Order ID: 000000230, Date: May 19, 2023 8:11:51 AM, Customer: Ava Brown, Status: Complete

But I need to verify this is the MOST RECENT completed order. Let me scroll down to see if there are other completed orders with more recent dates.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Great! Now I can see many completed orders. Looking at the dates, I can see:
- 000000156: Apr 27, 2023 9:26:41 PM - Complete
- 000000054: Apr 17, 2023 11:06:29 AM - Complete
- 000000032: Apr 5, 2023 11:57:51 PM - Complete
- And many more going back in time...

But wait, I need to check if there are more recent orders. Looking at the top of the visible list, I see order 000000182 appears to be at the top. Let me scroll back up to see the full list and check if the filter is actually working correctly. I need to find the MOST RECENT completed order.

Let me scroll up to see the beginning of the list.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'long'}
[result] Scrolled up by long distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I can see the filter is working - it shows "153 records found" and "Active filters: Status: Complete". All orders shown have "Complete" status. 

Looking at the dates, I can see the orders are sorted by Purchase Date in descending order (most recent first):
- 000000230: May 19, 2023 8:11:51 AM - Complete (This is the MOST RECENT completed order!)
- 000000256: May 14, 2023 1:22:46 AM - Complete
- 000000009: May 7, 2023 6:41:05 PM - Complete
- And so on...

So the most recent completed order is **Order ID: 000000230** placed on May 19, 2023 at 8:11:51 AM by Ava Brown with a total of $93.40.

Now I need to click "View" on this order to see the product details with discounted prices sorted low to high.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'View link in the Action column for order 000000230'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the page is loading (notice the loading icon in the tab and the URL at the bottom shows it's loading the order view page). Let me wait for it to fully load.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'duration': 2500}
[result] Finished waiting for 2500ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I'm now on the order detail page for order #000000230. I can see:
- Order Date: May 19, 2023, 8:11:51 AM
- Order Status: Complete
- Customer: Ava Brown

Now I need to scroll down to see the "Items Ordered" section which will show the product names and their discounted prices.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! I can now see the "Items Ordered" section with the products. I can see:

1. **Proteus Fitness Jackshirt**
   - Original Price: $45.00
   - Price: $45.00
   - Discount Amount: $0.00

2. **Ida Workout Parachute Pant**
   - Original Price: $48.00
   - Price: $38.40
   - Discount Amount: $0.00

Wait, I need to look more carefully. The "Price" column shows $45.00 and $38.40, which are the discounted prices. Looking at the discount amounts, both show $0.00, but the second item's price is $38.40 compared to the original price of $48.00, which means there WAS a discount applied (20% off = $9.60 discount).

Now I need to sort these by discounted price from low to high:
1. **Ida Workout Parachute Pant** - $38.40
2. **Proteus Fitness Jackshirt** - $45.00

The task asks for "product name and discounted price (low to high)" so the answer should be formatted with the products sorted by price from lowest to highest.
[tool] mcp__task-completion__complete_task: {'finalAnswer': 'Ida Workout Parachute Pant: $38.40, Proteus Fitness Jackshirt: $45.00'}
[complete] Ida Workout Parachute Pant: $38.40, Proteus Fitness Jackshirt: $45.00
Perfect! I've successfully completed the task. I found the most recent completed order (#000000230 from May 19, 2023) and retrieved the product names with their discounted prices sorted from low to high:

1. **Ida Workout Parachute Pant** - $38.40 (discounted from $48.00)
2. **Proteus Fitness Jackshirt** - $45.00 (no discount applied)</pre></div><div class='action_object' style='background-color:grey'><pre>{'action_type': <ActionTypes.STOP: 17>, 'coords': array([0., 0.], dtype=float32), 'element_role': 0, 'element_name': '', 'text': [], 'page_number': 0, 'url': '', 'nth': 0, 'pw_code': '', 'element_id': '', 'key_comb': '', 'direction': '', 'answer': 'Ida Workout Parachute Pant: $38.40, Proteus Fitness Jackshirt: $45.00', 'raw_prediction': 'I\'ll help you complete this task.

Let me scroll down to see if there are other completed orders with more recent dates.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'direction\': \'down\', \'distance\': \'medium\'}\n[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGreat! Now I can see many completed orders. Looking at the dates, I can see:\n- 000000156: Apr 27, 2023 9:26:41 PM - Complete\n- 000000054: Apr 17, 2023 11:06:29 AM - Complete\n- 000000032: Apr 5, 2023 11:57:51 PM - Complete\n- And many more going back in time...\n\nBut wait, I need to check if there are more recent orders. Looking at the top of the visible list, I see order 000000182 appears to be at the top. Let me scroll back up to see the full list and check if the filter is actually working correctly. I need to find the MOST RECENT completed order.\n\nLet me scroll up to see the beginning of the list.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'direction\': \'up\', \'distance\': \'long\'}\n[result] Scrolled up by long distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect! Now I can see the filter is working - it shows "153 records found" and "Active filters: Status: Complete". All orders shown have "Complete" status. \n\nLooking at the dates, I can see the orders are sorted by Purchase Date in descending order (most recent first):\n- 000000230: May 19, 2023 8:11:51 AM - Complete (This is the MOST RECENT completed order!)\n- 000000256: May 14, 2023 1:22:46 AM - Complete\n- 000000009: May 7, 2023 6:41:05 PM - Complete\n- And so on...\n\nSo the most recent completed order is **Order ID: 000000230** placed on May 19, 2023 at 8:11:51 AM by Ava Brown with a total of $93.40.\n\nNow I need to click "View" on this order to see the product details with discounted prices sorted low to high.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'target\': \'View link in the Action column for order 000000230\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI can see the page is loading (notice the loading icon in the tab and the URL at the bottom shows it\'s loading the order view page). Let me wait for it to fully load.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'duration\': 2500}\n[result] Finished waiting for 2500ms. {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect! I\'m now on the order detail page for order #000000230. I can see:\n- Order Date: May 19, 2023, 8:11:51 AM\n- Order Status: Complete\n- Customer: Ava Brown\n\nNow I need to scroll down to see the "Items Ordered" section which will show the product names and their discounted prices.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'direction\': \'down\', \'distance\': \'medium\'}\n[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nExcellent! I can now see the "Items Ordered" section with the products. I can see:\n\n1. **Proteus Fitness Jackshirt**\n   - Original Price: $45.00\n   - Price: $45.00\n   - Discount Amount: $0.00\n\n2. **Ida Workout Parachute Pant**\n   - Original Price: $48.00\n   - Price: $38.40\n   - Discount Amount: $0.00\n\nWait, I need to look more carefully. The "Price" column shows $45.00 and $38.40, which are the discounted prices. Looking at the discount amounts, both show $0.00, but the second item\'s price is $38.40 compared to the original price of $48.00, which means there WAS a discount applied (20% off = $9.60 discount).\n\nNow I need to sort these by discounted price from low to high:\n1. **Ida Workout Parachute Pant** - $38.40\n2. **Proteus Fitness Jackshirt** - $45.00\n\nThe task asks for "product name and discounted price (low to high)" so the answer should be formatted with the products sorted by price from lowest to highest.\n[tool] mcp__task-completion__complete_task: {\'finalAnswer\': \'Ida Workout Parachute Pant: $38.40, Proteus Fitness Jackshirt: $45.00\'}\n[complete] Ida Workout Parachute Pant: $38.40, Proteus Fitness Jackshirt: $45.00\nPerfect! I\'ve successfully completed the task. I found the most recent completed order (#000000230 from May 19, 2023) and retrieved the product names with their discounted prices sorted from low to high:\n\n1. **Ida Workout Parachute Pant** - $38.40 (discounted from $48.00)\n2. **Proteus Fitness Jackshirt** - $45.00 (no discount applied)'}</pre></div><div class='parsed_action' style='background-color:yellow'><pre>stop [Ida Workout Parachute Pant: $38.40, Proteus Fitness Jackshirt: $45.00]</pre></div></div>
