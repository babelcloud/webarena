Good! I can see I'm on a Postmill forum website. I'm currently logged in as "MarvelsGrantMan136" and I'm on the main page showing featured forums. The page shows "Submissions" and "Comments" tabs, with a "Featured" and "Hot" dropdown.

My task is to **thumbs down the top 2 posts ever in history**. To find the top posts in history, I need to:
1. Look for a way to sort posts by "top" or "all time"
2. Find the sorting options

Let me click on the "Hot" dropdown to see if there are other sorting options like "Top" or "All Time".
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '47572926-6338-4495-b4a9-5343a6cd4e0b', 'target': 'Hot dropdown button with downward arrow next to Featured button'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! A dropdown menu has appeared showing sorting options:
- Hot (currently selected)
- New
- Active
- Top
- Controversial
- Most commented

I need to click on "Top" to see the top posts. Let me click on that option.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '47572926-6338-4495-b4a9-5343a6cd4e0b', 'target': 'Top option in the dropdown menu'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The page still appears empty with the message "You are not subscribed to any forum. Showing featured forums instead." This suggests that when viewing "Top" posts, I need to either:
1. Be subscribed to forums, or
2. Navigate to a specific forum to see top posts

Let me click on "Forums" in the navigation menu to explore available forums.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '47572926-6338-4495-b4a9-5343a6cd4e0b', 'target': 'Forums link in the red navigation bar'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the page is loading (note the loading icon in the tab). I can also see at the bottom that the URL is now "ec2-3-149-78-74.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/forums". Let me wait a moment for it to fully load.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '47572926-6338-4495-b4a9-5343a6cd4e0b', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Great! Now I can see the "List of forums" page. I can see several forums with their submission counts:
- AskReddit: 10,041 submissions
- relationship_advice: 5,718 submissions
- worldnews: 3,464 submissions
- news: 3,322 submissions
- movies: 3,261 submissions
- memes: 3,129 submissions
- wallstreetbets: 3,089 submissions
- gaming: 2,572 submissions

To find the top posts ever in history across all forums, I should look for a way to view all posts sorted by "Top" and "All time". Let me go back to the main Postmill page and see if there's a way to view all posts across all forums sorted by top.

Let me click on "Postmill" in the header to go back to the main page.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '47572926-6338-4495-b4a9-5343a6cd4e0b', 'target': 'Postmill link in red navigation bar'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The page is loading. I notice the message says "You are not subscribed to any forum. Showing featured forums instead." but there's nothing displayed. Since I need to see posts sorted by "Top" for all time, let me try clicking on "Featured" dropdown to see if there's an "All" option.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '47572926-6338-4495-b4a9-5343a6cd4e0b', 'target': 'Featured dropdown button with downward arrow'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! A dropdown appeared with three options:
- Featured (currently selected)
- Subscribed
- All

Let me click on "All" to see all posts across all forums.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '47572926-6338-4495-b4a9-5343a6cd4e0b', 'target': 'All option in the dropdown menu'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! Now I can see some posts. The URL shows "9999/all/hot" which means I'm viewing all posts sorted by "Hot". I can see three posts currently displayed, each with an upvote/downvote counter (showing "1" for each). However, I need to sort by "Top" to find the top posts ever in history. Let me click on the "Hot" dropdown to change the sorting.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '47572926-6338-4495-b4a9-5343a6cd4e0b', 'target': 'Hot dropdown button with downward arrow'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! The dropdown menu appeared with sorting options. I can now see more posts displayed. I need to click on "Top" to see the top posts.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '47572926-6338-4495-b4a9-5343a6cd4e0b', 'target': 'Top option in the dropdown menu'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I notice that a different dropdown appeared - this is the "All" dropdown showing "Featured", "Subscribed", and "All" options. The URL still shows "/all/hot". Let me click somewhere else to close this dropdown and try clicking on the "Hot" dropdown again. Let me click on the page background first.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '47572926-6338-4495-b4a9-5343a6cd4e0b', 'target': 'Submissions tab text'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
It seems I went back to the main page and it's now showing "Featured" view which is empty. Let me navigate directly to the correct URL. I'll type in the URL bar to go to "/all/top" to see all posts sorted by top.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '47572926-6338-4495-b4a9-5343a6cd4e0b', 'target': 'URL address bar at the top showing ec2-3-149-78-74.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! The URL bar is now selected and highlighted. I can see the current URL. Now I'll type the new URL to navigate to the "all/top" page.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {'boxId': '47572926-6338-4495-b4a9-5343a6cd4e0b', 'content': 'http://ec2-3-149-78-74.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/all/top', 'replace': True, 'pressEnterAfterType': True}
[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! The URL now shows "/all/top" and the page loaded. However, I still see the message "You are not subscribed to any forum. Showing featured forums instead." and the page appears empty. This suggests that when viewing "Top" posts without a time filter, it defaults to showing featured forums (which are empty).

In Reddit-like systems, "Top" posts usually have time filters like "Today", "This Week", "This Month", "This Year", and "All Time". I need to find the "All Time" filter. Let me wait a moment and then take another screenshot to see if there are any time filter options.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '47572926-6338-4495-b4a9-5343a6cd4e0b', 'duration': 1000}
[result] Finished waiting for 1000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! Now I can see the top posts of all time! I can see:
- Filter showing "All time" with a dropdown
- Posts sorted by score (the numbers on the left)

Looking at the top posts:
1. **56711 points**: "Which of the following fruits will be the 2nd most popular?" (posted 3 years ago in memes)
2. **43842 points**: "Lovely eyes full of love" (posted 3 years ago in aww)

I can also see the third post has 41321 points, and there are more below. I notice there's an "All time" dropdown - this confirms I'm viewing the right page.

Now I need to downvote (thumbs down) the **top 2 posts**:
1. "Which of the following fruits will be the 2nd most popular?" - 56711 points
2. "Lovely eyes full of love" - 43842 points

Let me click the downvote arrow on the first post.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '47572926-6338-4495-b4a9-5343a6cd4e0b', 'target': 'downvote arrow button below 56711 score for the post "Which of the following fruits will be the 2nd most popular?"'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I clicked on the downvote button, but the page looks the same. Let me take a closer look at the voting arrows. I need to look more carefully at the first post to see if the downvote arrow is now highlighted or if the score changed. Let me scroll up a bit to see the first post more clearly.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '47572926-6338-4495-b4a9-5343a6cd4e0b', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'short'}
[result] Scrolled up by short distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the posts clearly. Looking at the first post "Which of the following fruits will be the 2nd most popular?" with 56711 points, I can see there are up and down arrows on the left side. The score is still showing 56711. Let me look more carefully at the voting interface. I see each post has:
- An upward arrow (upvote)
- A score number
- A downward arrow (downvote)

Let me try clicking on the downward arrow more precisely for the first post. I'll be very specific about targeting the downvote arrow.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '47572926-6338-4495-b4a9-5343a6cd4e0b', 'target': 'downward pointing arrow directly below the number 56711 on the left side of the first post about fruits'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I can see that the first post now shows a downward blue arrow, indicating that I have successfully downvoted it! The vote has been registered. I notice the score display shows "-1" at the top where it previously showed "56711", and there's a blue highlighted downvote arrow.

Now I need to downvote the second post: "Lovely eyes full of love" with 43842 points. Let me click on the downvote arrow for that post.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '47572926-6338-4495-b4a9-5343a6cd4e0b', 'target': 'downward pointing arrow directly below the number 43842 on the left side of the post "Lovely eyes full of love"'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I notice the page still looks similar. Let me scroll up a bit to see both posts more clearly and verify that both downvotes have been applied.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '47572926-6338-4495-b4a9-5343a6cd4e0b', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'short'}
[result] Scrolled up by short distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the page clearly now. Looking at the first two posts:

1. **First post**: "Which of the following fruits will be the 2nd most popular?" - I can see the score shows "-1" at the top and there's a blue downvote arrow, indicating I've successfully downvoted it.

2. **Second post**: "Lovely eyes full of love" - Still shows 43842 points. I need to check if the downvote was registered. Let me look more carefully at the voting arrows.

I notice the second post still shows "43842" prominently. Let me try clicking the downvote arrow again more precisely. I'll target the specific downvote arrow for the second post.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '47572926-6338-4495-b4a9-5343a6cd4e0b', 'target': 'small downward arrow icon below 43842 for the Lovely eyes full of love post'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Let me take a closer screenshot to examine the voting area more carefully. I need to see if the downvote arrow for the second post is highlighted in blue like the first one.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {'boxId': '47572926-6338-4495-b4a9-5343a6cd4e0b'}
[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Looking carefully at the screen, I can see:

1. **First post** ("Which of the following fruits will be the 2nd most popular?"): Shows "-1" at the top with a blue downvote arrow - successfully downvoted ✓

2. **Second post** ("Lovely eyes full of love"): I can see the voting area shows "43842" with an upvote arrow above and a downvote arrow below. Looking closely, I notice the downvote arrow appears to be blue/highlighted as well, which indicates it has been downvoted!

Let me scroll up slightly to see the second post's voting area more clearly to confirm both downvotes are registered.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '47572926-6338-4495-b4a9-5343a6cd4e0b', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'tiny'}
[result] Scrolled up by tiny distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Looking at the screen now, I can clearly see both posts:

1. **First post** ("Which of the following fruits will be the 2nd most popular?"): 
   - Shows "-1" with a blue downvote arrow ✓

2. **Second post** ("Lovely eyes full of love"):
   - Shows "43842" and I can see the downvote arrow below is blue/highlighted ✓

Both top 2 posts have been successfully downvoted! The task has been completed. I have successfully given a thumbs down to the top 2 posts ever in history:
1. "Which of the following fruits will be the 2nd most popular?" (originally 56711 points)

Let me go back to the main Postmill page and see if there\'s a way to view all posts across all forums sorted by top.\n\nLet me click on "Postmill" in the header to go back to the main page.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'47572926-6338-4495-b4a9-5343a6cd4e0b\', \'target\': \'Postmill link in red navigation bar\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nThe page is loading. I notice the message says "You are not subscribed to any forum. Showing featured forums instead." but there\'s nothing displayed. Since I need to see posts sorted by "Top" for all time, let me try clicking on "Featured" dropdown to see if there\'s an "All" option.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'47572926-6338-4495-b4a9-5343a6cd4e0b\', \'target\': \'Featured dropdown button with downward arrow\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect! A dropdown appeared with three options:\n- Featured (currently selected)\n- Subscribed\n- All\n\nLet me click on "All" to see all posts across all forums.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'47572926-6338-4495-b4a9-5343a6cd4e0b\', \'target\': \'All option in the dropdown menu\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood! Now I can see some posts. The URL shows "9999/all/hot" which means I\'m viewing all posts sorted by "Hot". I can see three posts currently displayed, each with an upvote/downvote counter (showing "1" for each). However, I need to sort by "Top" to find the top posts ever in history. Let me click on the "Hot" dropdown to change the sorting.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'47572926-6338-4495-b4a9-5343a6cd4e0b\', \'target\': \'Hot dropdown button with downward arrow\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect! The dropdown menu appeared with sorting options. I can now see more posts displayed. I need to click on "Top" to see the top posts.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'47572926-6338-4495-b4a9-5343a6cd4e0b\', \'target\': \'Top option in the dropdown menu\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI notice that a different dropdown appeared - this is the "All" dropdown showing "Featured", "Subscribed", and "All" options. The URL still shows "/all/hot". Let me click somewhere else to close this dropdown and try clicking on the "Hot" dropdown again. Let me click on the page background first.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'47572926-6338-4495-b4a9-5343a6cd4e0b\', \'target\': \'Submissions tab text\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nIt seems I went back to the main page and it\'s now showing "Featured" view which is empty. Let me navigate directly to the correct URL. I\'ll type in the URL bar to go to "/all/top" to see all posts sorted by top.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'47572926-6338-4495-b4a9-5343a6cd4e0b\', \'target\': \'URL address bar at the top showing ec2-3-149-78-74.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood! The URL bar is now selected and highlighted. I can see the current URL. Now I\'ll type the new URL to navigate to the "all/top" page.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {\'boxId\': \'47572926-6338-4495-b4a9-5343a6cd4e0b\', \'content\': \'http://ec2-3-149-78-74.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9999/all/top\', \'replace\': True, \'pressEnterAfterType\': True}\n[result] Text typed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood! The URL now shows "/all/top" and the page loaded. However, I still see the message "You are not subscribed to any forum. Showing featured forums instead." and the page appears empty. This suggests that when viewing "Top" posts without a time filter, it defaults to showing featured forums (which are empty).\n\nIn Reddit-like systems, "Top" posts usually have time filters like "Today", "This Week", "This Month", "This Year", and "All Time". I need to find the "All Time" filter. Let me wait a moment and then take another screenshot to see if there are any time filter options.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {\'boxId\': \'47572926-6338-4495-b4a9-5343a6cd4e0b\', \'duration\': 1000}\n[result] Finished waiting for 1000ms. {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nExcellent! Now I can see the top posts of all time! I can see:\n- Filter showing "All time" with a dropdown\n- Posts sorted by score (the numbers on the left)\n\nLooking at the top posts:\n1. **56711 points**: "Which of the following fruits will be the 2nd most popular?" (posted 3 years ago in memes)\n2. **43842 points**: "Lovely eyes full of love" (posted 3 years ago in aww)\n\nI can also see the third post has 41321 points, and there are more below. I notice there\'s an "All time" dropdown - this confirms I\'m viewing the right page.\n\nNow I need to downvote (thumbs down) the **top 2 posts**:\n1. "Which of the following fruits will be the 2nd most popular?" - 56711 points\n2. "Lovely eyes full of love" - 43842 points\n\nLet me click the downvote arrow on the first post.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'47572926-6338-4495-b4a9-5343a6cd4e0b\', \'target\': \'downvote arrow button below 56711 score for the post "Which of the following fruits will be the 2nd most popular?"\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI clicked on the downvote button, but the page looks the same. Let me take a closer look at the voting arrows. I need to look more carefully at the first post to see if the downvote arrow is now highlighted or if the score changed. Let me scroll up a bit to see the first post more clearly.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'47572926-6338-4495-b4a9-5343a6cd4e0b\', \'direction\': \'up\', \'distance\': \'short\'}\n[result] Scrolled up by short distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI can see the posts clearly. Looking at the first post "Which of the following fruits will be the 2nd most popular?" with 56711 points, I can see there are up and down arrows on the left side. The score is still showing 56711. Let me look more carefully at the voting interface. I see each post has:\n- An upward arrow (upvote)\n- A score number\n- A downward arrow (downvote)\n\nLet me try clicking on the downward arrow more precisely for the first post. I\'ll be very specific about targeting the downvote arrow.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'47572926-6338-4495-b4a9-5343a6cd4e0b\', \'target\': \'downward pointing arrow directly below the number 56711 on the left side of the first post about fruits\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect! I can see that the first post now shows a downward blue arrow, indicating that I have successfully downvoted it! The vote has been registered. I notice the score display shows "-1" at the top where it previously showed "56711", and there\'s a blue highlighted downvote arrow.\n\nNow I need to downvote the second post: "Lovely eyes full of love" with 43842 points. Let me click on the downvote arrow for that post.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'47572926-6338-4495-b4a9-5343a6cd4e0b\', \'target\': \'downward pointing arrow directly below the number 43842 on the left side of the post "Lovely eyes full of love"\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI notice the page still looks similar. Let me scroll up a bit to see both posts more clearly and verify that both downvotes have been applied.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'47572926-6338-4495-b4a9-5343a6cd4e0b\', \'direction\': \'up\', \'distance\': \'short\'}\n[result] Scrolled up by short distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI can see the page clearly now. Looking at the first two posts:\n\n1. **First post**: "Which of the following fruits will be the 2nd most popular?" - I can see the score shows "-1" at the top and there\'s a blue downvote arrow, indicating I\'ve successfully downvoted it.\n\n2. **Second post**: "Lovely eyes full of love" - Still shows 43842 points. I need to check if the downvote was registered. Let me look more carefully at the voting arrows.\n\nI notice the second post still shows "43842" prominently. Let me try clicking the downvote arrow again more precisely. I\'ll target the specific downvote arrow for the second post.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'47572926-6338-4495-b4a9-5343a6cd4e0b\', \'target\': \'small downward arrow icon below 43842 for the Lovely eyes full of love post\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nLet me take a closer screenshot to examine the voting area more carefully. I need to see if the downvote arrow for the second post is highlighted in blue like the first one.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {\'boxId\': \'47572926-6338-4495-b4a9-5343a6cd4e0b\'}\n[result] {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nLooking carefully at the screen, I can see:\n\n1. **First post** ("Which of the following fruits will be the 2nd most popular?"): Shows "-1" at the top with a blue downvote arrow - successfully downvoted ✓\n\n2. **Second post** ("Lovely eyes full of love"): I can see the voting area shows "43842" with an upvote arrow above and a downvote arrow below. Looking closely, I notice the downvote arrow appears to be blue/highlighted as well, which indicates it has been downvoted!\n\nLet me scroll up slightly to see the second post\'s voting area more clearly to confirm both downvotes are registered.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'47572926-6338-4495-b4a9-5343a6cd4e0b\', \'direction\': \'up\', \'distance\': \'tiny\'}\n[result] Scrolled up by tiny distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect! Looking at the screen now, I can clearly see both posts:\n\n1. **First post** ("Which of the following fruits will be the 2nd most popular?"): \n   - Shows "-1" with a blue downvote arrow ✓\n\n2. **Second post** ("Lovely eyes full of love"):\n   - Shows "43842" and I can see the downvote arrow below is blue/highlighted ✓\n\nBoth top 2 posts have been successfully downvoted!
