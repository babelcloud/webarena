Good! I can see there's an OpenStreetMap tab already open. Let me switch to that tab and take a screenshot to see the current state.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__switch_tab: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'tabId': '2'}
[result] Switched to tab 2 successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I can see OpenStreetMap is open and showing a map that includes both Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. There's a welcome dialog open. Let me close it first by clicking the X button, then I'll use the directions/routing feature to find the driving time between Pittsburgh and Philadelphia.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'X button on the Welcome to OpenStreetMap dialog box in the top right corner of the welcome message'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! The welcome dialog is closed. Now I can see the map clearly with both Pittsburgh and Philadelphia visible. I need to access the directions/routing feature. I can see there's a search box at the top left, and I notice there's a small icon next to the "Go" button that looks like it might be for directions. Let me look for a directions button. I'll click on the icon next to the search box that appears to be a directions/routing icon.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Blue icon button with arrows next to the Go button in the search area at the top left'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! The directions panel has opened. I can see:
- A "From" field (with a green marker icon)
- A "To" field (with a red marker icon)
- A dropdown showing "Car (OSRM)" which is perfect for finding driving time
- A "Go" button
- A "Reverse Directions" link

Now I need to enter Pittsburgh in the "From" field and Philadelphia in the "To" field. Let me click on the "From" field first.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'From input field with green marker icon on the left side of the directions panel'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good, the "From" field should now be active. Let me type "Pittsburgh" into it.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'content': 'Pittsburgh', 'pressEnterAfterType': False}
[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I notice that the text "Pittsburgh" was typed but I don't see it appearing in the From field in the screenshot. Let me take a fresh screenshot to see the current state.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86'}
[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I see the fields are still empty. The text might not have been entered properly. Let me try clicking directly in the "From" input field text area and then typing again.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'White text input box next to the word "From" in the directions panel'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I can see the "From" field is now focused (it has a blue border). Now let me type "Pittsburgh" in it.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'content': 'Pittsburgh', 'pressEnterAfterType': False}
[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! "Pittsburgh" has been entered in the "From" field. Now I need to click on the "To" field and enter "Philadelphia".
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'White text input box next to the word "To" with the red marker icon in the directions panel'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I can see that:
1. The "From" field now shows "Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, United States" - the system has auto-completed it
2. A green marker has been placed on the map showing Pittsburgh's location
3. The "To" field is now focused (with blue border)

Now let me type "Philadelphia" in the "To" field.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'content': 'Philadelphia', 'pressEnterAfterType': False}
[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! "Philadelphia" has been entered in the "To" field. Now I have:
- From: Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, United States
- To: Philadelphia
- Transport mode: Car (OSRM)

Now I need to click the "Go" button to calculate the route and get the driving time.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Blue Go button in the directions panel'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Great! I can see the route is being calculated. The system has:
1. Auto-completed the destination to "Philadelphia, Philadelphia County, United States"
2. Placed a red marker on Philadelphia
3. Placed a green marker on Pittsburgh
4. There's a loading spinner in the directions panel indicating it's calculating the route

Let me wait a moment for the route calculation to complete.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! The route has been calculated successfully! I can see the "Directions" panel with the key information at the top:

**Distance: 491km. Time: 5:47.**

The route is shown in blue on the map connecting Pittsburgh (green marker) to Philadelphia (visible on the right side), and there's a detailed turn-by-turn direction list below.

The driving time from Pittsburgh to Philadelphia by car is **5:47** (5 hours and 47 minutes).
[tool] mcp__task-completion__complete_task: {'finalAnswer': '5:47'}
[complete] 5:47
Task completed!
