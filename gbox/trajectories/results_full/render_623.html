I can see there are 2 tabs open. Tab 2 appears to be a Postmill instance (which is a Reddit-like platform). Let me switch to that tab and take a screenshot.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__switch_tab: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'tabId': '2'}
[result] Switched to tab 2 successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I'm on the Postmill platform (a Reddit-like site). I can see I'm logged in as "MarvelsGrantMan136". Now I need to find a subreddit related to relationships where I can ask for gift advice for a birthday.

Looking at the subscribed forums on the right, I don't see any relationship-focused subreddits. Let me search for relationship-related forums. I'll click on the search bar.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'search bar in the red header with white text field'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good, the search bar is now active (I can see the cursor in it). Let me search for "relationship" or "relations" to find a subreddit related to relationships.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'content': 'relationship', 'pressEnterAfterType': True}
[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the search has been entered but the page is still loading (notice the loading icon in the tab). Let me wait a moment for the search results to load.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I found search results for "relationship". I can see several posts in relationship-related subreddits. I notice there are posts in "relationship_advice" forum. Let me click on one of these to navigate to that subreddit, or I can look for a forum link. I see several posts are from "relationship_advice" - let me click on that forum name to go to that subreddit.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'relationship_advice link in the first search result'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the URL has changed to show "relationship_advice" in the bottom left corner. Let me wait for the page to fully load and take a screenshot.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'duration': 2000}

Excellent! I'm now on the /r/relationship_advice subreddit. This is a relationship-focused subreddit where I can ask for advice about a birthday gift. Now I need to create a new post. I'll click on the "+ Submit" button in the header.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': '+ Submit button in the red header navigation bar'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the tab title changed to "Create submission" and the URL shows "submit/relationship_advice". The page is loading. Let me wait for it to fully load.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! The submission form has loaded. I can see:
- A URL field (optional)
- A Title field (required, marked with *)
- A Body field
- Forum dropdown (already set to "relationship_advice")
- A "Create submission" button

Now I need to fill in the form to ask for advice about a birthday gift. Let me start by clicking on the Title field and entering a title.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Title text input field below the Title * label'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! The title field is now focused (I can see the red border around it). Now I'll type a title for my post asking for birthday gift advice.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'content': 'Need advice on birthday gift for my partner', 'pressEnterAfterType': False}
[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! The title has been entered: "Need advice on birthday gift for my partner". Now I need to click on the Body field and add some content to the post.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Body text area field below the Body label'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! The Body field is now focused (I can see the red border around it). Now I'll type the body content asking for birthday gift advice.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'content': "Hi everyone! My partner's birthday is coming up soon and I'm struggling to find the perfect gift.

[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I've filled in both the title and body of the post:
- Title: "Need advice on birthday gift for my partner"
- Body: A detailed message asking for advice about birthday gift suggestions

The forum is already set to "relationship_advice" which is correct. Now I need to click the "Create submission" button to post this to the subreddit.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Create submission red button at the bottom of the form'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Great! I can see that the page has updated and now shows a "Preview" section with the formatted content of my post. The URL has also changed to include the post slug "need-advice-on-birthday-gift-for-my-partner". This appears to be a preview page before final submission. I can still see the "Create submission" button at the bottom. Let me click it again to finalize the submission.
