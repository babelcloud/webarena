Perfect! I found the post about supporting local bookstores. The post is titled "Friendly reminder bookshop.org exists." and it contains very important information:

**Post content:**
"Saw it's been a few months since this website was discussed. I actually just discovered it last night. Local bookstores are so important and they have so much character we should all do what we can to support this.

This website allows you to select a local bookstore in your area and 30% of any book purchase on the website goes to the store.

I think it is amazing!"

**From the first comment (367 votes):**
"I'm a manager at an indie bookstore and I agree. Bookshop.org is wonderful! It honestly helped keep a lot of smaller indies alive during the pandemic.

I'd also encourage folks to checkout their local indie's website. It may promote things like free in-store events, indie-exclusive editions of new books, locally self-published authors, or signed bookplates. Plus a lot of them are unionized!

Thank you so much for supporting independent bookstores and have a wonderful new year."

So the post is about **Bookshop.org**, which is a website that supports local independent bookstores by giving them 30% of book purchases. Let me scroll down to see if there are any other organizations mentioned in the comments.

Good information! I can see a key comment (120 votes) that states: "Most local bookstores will also order books for you and then they get 100% of the profit. But Bookshop.org is a great alternative if you don't actually visit your local bookstores often."

This reinforces that the main organizations involved are Bookshop.org and local independent bookstores. Let me continue scrolling to see if there are any other specific organizations mentioned.

The post is titled "Friendly reminder bookshop.org exists." and it contains very important information:\n\n**Post content:**\n"Saw it\'s been a few months since this website was discussed. I actually just discovered it last night. Local bookstores are so important and they have so much character we should all do what we can to support this.\n\nThis website allows you to select a local bookstore in your area and 30% of any book purchase on the website goes to the store.\n\nI think it is amazing!"\n\n**From the first comment (367 votes):**\n"I\'m a manager at an indie bookstore and I agree. Bookshop.org is wonderful! It honestly helped keep a lot of smaller indies alive during the pandemic.\n\nI\'d also encourage folks to checkout their local indie\'s website. It may promote things like free in-store events, indie-exclusive editions of new books, locally self-published authors, or signed bookplates. Plus a lot of them are unionized!\n\nThank you so much for supporting independent bookstores and have a wonderful new year."\n\nSo the post is about **Bookshop.org**, which is a website that supports local independent bookstores by giving them 30% of book purchases.
