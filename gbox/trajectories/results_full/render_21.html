Good! I can see I'm on a product page for "6S Wireless Headphones Over Ear" on the One Stop Market website. I can see there are "12 Reviews" listed. I need to access those reviews to find which reviewers mention that ear cups are small.

Let me click on the "12 Reviews" link to view the reviews.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': '12 Reviews link next to the star rating'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I can now see the Customer Reviews section. I can see several reviews and I've already spotted some relevant ones:

1. **Catso** - Review titled "Too small, did not hold charge." - mentions "they really are for people with very small ears"
2. **A reviewer (name appears to be cut off)** - Review titled "Cup for ears very small" - mentions "The ear cups MAY be ok for children (dint have any to test this on), but for adult sized ears they are way too small"

Let me scroll down to see all 12 reviews to make sure I capture all reviewers who mention small ear cups.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see more reviews now. Let me continue scrolling to see all the reviews and identify everyone who mentions small ear cups.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I found another reviewer mentioning ear cups:

**Anglebert Dinkherhump** - In their review "not bad and folding is good for travel", they mention: "These are NOT over the ear cups. I got about half my ear into it and the rest is on top so for long listening it may hurt the ears."

And I can see at the bottom of the visible area there's more text about ear cups from another review that mentions "For small ears the padding goes over their ears. It won't go over mine as I'm an adult with adult sized ears ???? lol."

Let me continue scrolling to see all remaining reviews.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see there's pagination - "1 2" with a next arrow, which means there's a second page of reviews. Let me scroll back up to see the review from Michelle Davis that I just passed, and then check the second page.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'short'}
[result] Scrolled up by short distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I can see the complete review from **Michelle Davis/Michelle Davis**. The review says: "For small ears the padding goes over their ears. It won't go over mine as I'm an adult with adult sized ears ???? lol. But the kids really like them."

Now let me scroll down and click on page 2 to see if there are more reviews mentioning small ear cups.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the pagination at the top. Let me click on page "2" to see the remaining reviews.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'page number 2 link in pagination'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
It seems the page didn't change to show the reviews on page 2. Let me scroll up to see if the reviews are loaded above.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'long'}
[result] Scrolled up by long distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I'm back at the product page. Let me scroll down to the reviews section and try to navigate to page 2 properly.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'long'}
[result] Scrolled down by long distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I can see the pagination controls now with "1 2" in the middle. I'm currently on page 1. Let me click on "2" to view the second page of reviews.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'number 2 in pagination controls'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
It seems the page didn't change. The pagination might be broken or there might only be reviews on page 1. Let me scroll up to see if there are different reviews loaded above, or I'll work with what I've already seen.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'long'}
[result] Scrolled up by long distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good, I can see we're on the reviews section. It looks like clicking on page 2 didn't work or there may be an issue with the pagination. Let me scroll through all the reviews on this page carefully to make sure I've captured everyone who mentions small ear cups. Let me scroll down through all the reviews again to compile the complete list.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'short'}
[result] Scrolled down by short distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the pagination still shows "1 2". Let me try scrolling up to see all the reviews from the beginning and make a complete list. I'll need to carefully go through all reviews on page 1 first.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'long'}
[result] Scrolled up by long distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I'm at the beginning of the reviews section. I can see the first review is from **Michelle Davis** which mentions: "For small ears the padding goes over their ears. It won't go over mine as I'm an adult with adult sized ears ???? lol."

Now let me scroll down slowly and carefully document all reviewers who mention small ear cups. I'll go through each review systematically.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'short'}
[result] Scrolled down by short distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see a review from **Amazon Customer** with the title "Terrible quality" - this review doesn't mention ear cups being small.

I can see the pagination shows "1 2", so there are definitely 2 pages. Let me try clicking the "2" link to access page 2 of the reviews.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': '2 link in the pagination area'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The page content didn't change. It seems the pagination might not be working properly. Based on what I've already seen by scrolling through the reviews, I have identified the following reviewers who mentioned that the ear cups are small:

1. **Catso** - mentioned "they really are for people with very small ears"
2. **Dibbins** - The review title was "Cup for ears very small" and mentioned "The ear cups MAY be ok for children (dint have any to test this on), but for adult sized ears they are way too small"
3. **Anglebert Dinkherhump** - mentioned "These are NOT over the ear cups. I got about half my ear into it and the rest is on top"
4. **Michelle Davis** - mentioned "For small ears the padding goes over their ears. It won't go over mine as I'm an adult with adult sized ears ???? lol"

Let me scroll up to the beginning of the reviews to verify I haven't missed anyone and to double-check the reviewer names.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'long'}
[result] Scrolled up by long distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I can see the first review clearly now. It's from **Michelle Davis** and mentions: "For small ears the padding goes over their ears. It won't go over mine as I'm an adult with adult sized ears ???? lol."

Now let me scroll down carefully through all the reviews to make sure I capture everyone who mentions small ear cups.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'short'}
[result] Scrolled down by short distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the review from **Amazon Customer** titled "Terrible quality" - this doesn't mention ear cups being small. This appears to be the end of page 1. Let me now click on page 2 to see the remaining reviews.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': '2 in the pagination controls'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The pagination doesn't seem to be working. Let me scroll up to see if page 2 content loaded above.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'long'}
[result] Scrolled up by long distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I'm back at the same page 1 content. The pagination seems to be broken. However, I recall from my earlier scrolling that I saw additional reviews. Let me carefully scroll through the entire page to document all the reviews I can see. Let me continue scrolling down to see all reviews on this page.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the pagination showing "1 2" but I'm only seeing 2 reviews on page 1 (Michelle Davis and Amazon Customer). Let me scroll back up and then systematically go through all the reviews I saw earlier. Let me scroll up to start from the beginning.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'long'}
[result] Scrolled up by long distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! Now I can see:
1. **Michelle Davis** - mentions "For small ears the padding goes over their ears. It won't go over mine as I'm an adult with adult sized ears ???? lol."
2. **Amazon Customer** - "Terrible quality" - doesn't mention ear cups being small

Let me click on the "Reviews (12)" tab to see if it will reload and show all reviews properly.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'Reviews (12) tab'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see page 1 is showing only 2 reviews. The pagination shows "1 2" which means there's a page 2. Earlier when I scrolled, I definitely saw more reviews including ones from Catso, Dibbins, Anglebert Dinkherhump, JGonzo, and others. Let me try using the next arrow button to navigate to page 2.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'next page arrow button after the number 2 in pagination'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! Now I'm on page 2 and I can see more reviews! I can already see:

1. **Jenna Kaufman** - "Great" - doesn't mention ear cups being small
2. **Joseph Brzezinski** - "Love these headphones" - doesn't mention ear cups being small
3. **Catso** - "Too small, did not hold charge." - mentions "they really are for people with very small ears"
4. A review titled "Cup for ears very small" - mentions "The ear cups MAY be ok for children (dint have any to test this on), but for adult sized ears they are way too small"

Let me scroll down to see the rest of the reviews and identify all reviewers who mention small ear cups.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'short'}
[result] Scrolled down by short distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I can now see the reviewer name for the "Cup for ears very small" review - it's **Dibbins**. I also see:
- **WillWill** - doesn't mention ear cups being small
- **hrw81** - "So far, so good" - doesn't mention ear cups being small
- "Terrible quality" review starting at the bottom

Let me continue scrolling to see the remaining reviews.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! I found more reviews:

- Another **Amazon Customer** - "Terrible quality" - doesn't mention ear cups
- **Anglebert Dinkherhump** - "not bad and folding is good for travel" - mentions "These are NOT over the ear cups. I got about half my ear into it and the rest is on top"
- **JGonzo** - "just what I was looking for" - doesn't mention ear cups being small
- The bottom review starting with "Yeah so what..." mentions "For small ears the padding goes over their ears. It won't go over mine as I'm an adult with adult sized ears"

Let me scroll down a bit more to see the complete last review and confirm the reviewer's name.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'short'}
[result] Scrolled down by short distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I can see that last review is also from **Michelle Davis** (shown as "Michelle Davis/Michelle Davis"). That's the same person who had a review on page 1, so it appears this is a duplicate or the system shows the name twice.

Now I have reviewed all the pages and found all reviewers who mentioned ear cups being small. Based on my thorough review of all 12 reviews across both pages, here are the reviewers who mentioned ear cups being small:

1. **Catso** - mentioned "they really are for people with very small ears"
2. **Dibbins** - mentioned "The ear cups MAY be ok for children (dint have any to test this on), but for adult sized ears they are way too small"
3. **Anglebert Dinkherhump** - mentioned "These are NOT over the ear cups. I got about half my ear into it and the rest is on top"
4. **Michelle Davis** - mentioned "For small ears the padding goes over their ears. It won't go over mine as I'm an adult with adult sized ears"
[tool] mcp__task-completion__complete_task: {'finalAnswer': 'Catso, Dibbins, Anglebert Dinkherhump, Michelle Davis'}
[complete] Catso, Dibbins, Anglebert Dinkherhump, Michelle Davis
The task is complete! I found 4 reviewers who mentioned that the ear cups are small:

1. **Catso**
2. **Dibbins**
3. **Anglebert Dinkherhump**
4. **Michelle Davis**</pre></div><div class='action_object' style='background-color:grey'><pre>{'action_type': <ActionTypes.STOP: 17>, 'coords': array([0., 0.], dtype=float32), 'element_role': 0, 'element_name': '', 'text': [], 'page_number': 0, 'url': '', 'nth': 0, 'pw_code': '', 'element_id': '', 'key_comb': '', 'direction': '', 'answer': 'Catso, Dibbins, Anglebert Dinkherhump, Michelle Davis', 'raw_prediction': 'I\'ll help you complete this task.

I found another reviewer mentioning ear cups:\n\n**Anglebert Dinkherhump** - In their review "not bad and folding is good for travel", they mention: "These are NOT over the ear cups. I got about half my ear into it and the rest is on top so for long listening it may hurt the ears."\n\nAnd I can see at the bottom of the visible area there\'s more text about ear cups from another review that mentions "For small ears the padding goes over their ears. It won\'t go over mine as I\'m an adult with adult sized ears ???? lol."\n\nLet me continue scrolling to see all remaining reviews.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'direction\': \'down\', \'distance\': \'medium\'}\n[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI can see there\'s pagination - "1 2" with a next arrow, which means there\'s a second page of reviews. Let me scroll back up to see the review from Michelle Davis that I just passed, and then check the second page.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'direction\': \'up\', \'distance\': \'short\'}\n[result] Scrolled up by short distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect!

I\'m at the beginning of the reviews section. I can see the first review is from **Michelle Davis** which mentions: "For small ears the padding goes over their ears. It won\'t go over mine as I\'m an adult with adult sized ears ???? lol."\n\nNow let me scroll down slowly and carefully document all reviewers who mention small ear cups.

Based on what I\'ve already seen by scrolling through the reviews, I have identified the following reviewers who mentioned that the ear cups are small:\n\n1. **Catso** - mentioned "they really are for people with very small ears"\n2. **Dibbins** - The review title was "Cup for ears very small" and mentioned "The ear cups MAY be ok for children (dint have any to test this on), but for adult sized ears they are way too small"\n3. **Anglebert Dinkherhump** - mentioned "These are NOT over the ear cups.

I can already see:\n\n1. **Jenna Kaufman** - "Great" - doesn\'t mention ear cups being small\n2. **Joseph Brzezinski** - "Love these headphones" - doesn\'t mention ear cups being small\n3. **Catso** - "Too small, did not hold charge." - mentions "they really are for people with very small ears"\n4. A review titled "Cup for ears very small" - mentions "The ear cups MAY be ok for children (dint have any to test this on), but for adult sized ears they are way too small"\n\nLet me scroll down to see the rest of the reviews and identify all reviewers who mention small ear cups.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'direction\': \'down\', \'distance\': \'short\'}\n[result] Scrolled down by short distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect!

I got about half my ear into it and the rest is on top"\n- **JGonzo** - "just what I was looking for" - doesn\'t mention ear cups being small\n- The bottom review starting with "Yeah so what..." mentions "For small ears the padding goes over their ears.

I can see that last review is also from **Michelle Davis** (shown as "Michelle Davis/Michelle Davis"). That\'s the same person who had a review on page 1, so it appears this is a duplicate or the system shows the name twice.\n\nNow I have reviewed all the pages and found all reviewers who mentioned ear cups being small. Based on my thorough review of all 12 reviews across both pages, here are the reviewers who mentioned ear cups being small:\n\n1. **Catso** - mentioned "they really are for people with very small ears"\n2. **Dibbins** - mentioned "The ear cups MAY be ok for children (dint have any to test this on), but for adult sized ears they are way too small"\n3. **Anglebert Dinkherhump** - mentioned "These are NOT over the ear cups.
