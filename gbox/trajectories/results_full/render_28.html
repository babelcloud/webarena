Excellent! The click worked and I'm now on the user profile page for **mineihussdon**. I can see:

- User: mineihussdon (registered 3 years ago)
- Currently viewing the "Overview" tab
- I can see several comments and posts displayed on this page

I can see several comments already visible on the overview page. Each comment shows:
- Upvote count (top number)
- Downvote count (bottom number)

Let me examine the visible comments:
1. First comment: -2 upvotes (actually shows up arrow with 3, down arrow, "Hi")
2. "Best place for a foot rub?" - this is a post (0 upvotes, 0 downvotes)
3. Comment with 1 upvote, 0 downvotes - "My vote is for Bodhe."
4. Comment with 1 upvote, 0 downvotes - "This is a great question!"
5. Comment with 5 upvotes, 0 downvotes - "That's fair."
6. Comment with 1 upvote, 0 downvotes - "I was thinking about that."
7. Comment with 2 upvotes, 0 downvotes - visible at bottom

I need to click on the "Comments" tab to see all of the user's comments in one place, which will make it easier to count those with more downvotes than upvotes.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Comments tab'}

Good! I'm now on the Comments tab. I can see only 2 comments visible:

1. **First comment**: Shows upvote arrow with "-2" and downvote arrow - Comment text: "Hi" 
   - This has -2 upvotes (net score), which means it has more downvotes than upvotes

2. **Second comment**: Shows upvote arrow with "1" and downvote arrow with "0" - Comment text: "My vote is for Bodhe."
   - This has 1 upvote and 0 downvotes (more upvotes than downvotes)

I notice the page shows only 2 comments currently. Let me scroll down to see if there are more comments below.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Great! I can see more comments now. Let me analyze the voting patterns on the visible comments:

1. Comment with 1 upvote, 0 downvotes - "Good call. I actually love the Worcester Library!..." (more upvotes)
2. Comment with 2 upvotes, 0 downvotes - "Wow. That's pretty cool." (more upvotes)
3. Comment with 2 upvotes, 0 downvotes - "Thank you! Where are they out of?" (more upvotes)
4. Comment with 5 upvotes, 0 downvotes - "I like to read, bike ride, be outdoors." (more upvotes)
5. Comment with 1 upvote, 0 downvotes - "Very cool" (more upvotes)
6. Comment with 1 upvote, 0 downvotes - "And is it take out or dine in?" (more upvotes)
7. Comment with 1 upvote, 0 downvotes - "Where is it?" (more upvotes)
8. Comment with 1 upvote (partially visible at bottom)

Let me continue scrolling to see if there are more comments.

Let me continue scrolling to see if there are more comments below.

Good! I can see more comments and there's a "More" button at the bottom. I can see all these comments have:
- 1 upvote, 0 downvotes each

I also notice one comment with **2 upvotes, 0 downvotes**: "I completely agree. And I miss actual books, not e-books."

Let me click the "More" button to see if there are additional comments.

The page looks the same. Let me wait a moment for it to load and then take another screenshot.

Great! The "More" button worked and I can see additional comments. Let me note the voting on these new comments:

1. Comment with 1 upvote, 0 downvotes - "There's still one in Westbrook..."
2. Comment with **4 upvotes**, 0 downvotes - "Awesome!"

6. Comment with 1 upvote, 0 downvotes - "r/worcesternassocialclub"
7. Comment with 1 upvote, 0 downvotes - "I just created it! Come over and join!"

It looks like I've reached the end of the comments list. Now let me scroll back to the top to do a complete count. I need to carefully count all comments that have more downvotes than upvotes. Let me scroll back to the beginning.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'long'}
[result] Scrolled up by long distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good, I'm back in the middle of the comments. Let me continue scrolling up to get to the very beginning.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'long'}
[result] Scrolled up by long distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Let me scroll up one more time to see the very first comments at the top of the page.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'long'}
[result] Scrolled up by long distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The page doesn't seem to be scrolling up anymore. It looks like this might be the start of the loaded comments after clicking "More". Let me check if there are earlier comments by looking at the URL. I notice the URL has a timestamp parameter. Let me scroll to the very top of the page first to see if the initial comments are there.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'keys': ['home']}
[result] Keys pressed successfully

[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I notice the URL shows we're viewing comments with a specific timestamp filter. The first two comments I saw earlier (with -2 upvotes and the "My vote is for Bodhe" comment) are missing from this view. Let me navigate back to the comments page without the timestamp filter to see all comments from the beginning.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Comments tab'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The URL still has the timestamp filter. Let me click on the username "mineihussdon" in the profile box on the right to navigate back to the clean profile page.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'mineihussdon username in the profile box on the right side'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I'm back on the clean profile page and I can see the first comment with **-2** score (which means it has more downvotes than upvotes). Now let me click on the Comments tab to see all comments in a clean list.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Comments tab'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I notice I'm now on the Overview tab, not the Comments tab. I can see the first comment at the top with **-2** upvotes (meaning it has more downvotes than upvotes). Let me click on the Comments tab which should be next to Overview.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Comments tab link next to Overview'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I'm on the Comments tab with all comments listed. I can see the first comment at the top has **-2** (net score showing more downvotes than upvotes). Now let me systematically go through all comments by scrolling down and counting those with more downvotes than upvotes. 

Based on what I can see:
1. First comment: **-2** - "Hi" (MORE DOWNVOTES THAN UPVOTES - COUNT: 1)
2. Second: 1 upvote, 0 downvotes - "My vote is for Bodhe"
3. Third: 1 upvote, 0 downvotes - "This is a great question!"
4. Fourth: 5 upvotes, 0 downvotes - "That's fair."
5. Fifth: 1 upvote, 0 downvotes - "I was thinking about that."
6. Sixth: 2 upvotes, 0 downvotes - "Good suggestion! Thank you!"

Let me scroll down to see all remaining comments.

I can see more comments and there's a "More" button again. I notice one comment with 2 upvotes ("I completely agree. And I miss actual books, not e-books."). Let me click "More" to load additional comments.

Good! I can see more comments now. I notice:

Perfect! I've reached the end of the comments list. Now let me count all the comments I've seen throughout my scrolling.

Based on my complete review of all the comments, I found that **only 1 comment** has more downvotes than upvotes:

The first comment with a score of **-2** (meaning it has 2 net downvotes compared to upvotes) with the text "Hi"

All other comments either have:
- Positive scores (1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 upvotes with 0 downvotes)
- Zero score (0 upvotes and 0 downvotes)

None of the other comments showed more downvotes than upvotes. A score of 0 means equal upvotes and downvotes (or no votes at all), which doesn't qualify as "more downvotes than upvotes."
[tool] mcp__task-completion__complete_task: {'finalAnswer': '1'}
[complete] 1
The answer is **1**.

The user who made the latest post on the Worcester forum is **mineihussdon**, and they have **1 comment** that has received more downvotes than upvotes - the comment that says "Hi" with a score of -2.</pre></div><div class='action_object' style='background-color:grey'><pre>{'action_type': <ActionTypes.STOP: 17>, 'coords': array([0., 0.], dtype=float32), 'element_role': 0, 'element_name': '', 'text': [], 'page_number': 0, 'url': '', 'nth': 0, 'pw_code': '', 'element_id': '', 'key_comb': '', 'direction': '', 'answer': '1', 'raw_prediction': 'I\'ll take a screenshot first to see the current state of the page and continue from where we left off.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\'}\n[result] {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nExcellent!

And I miss actual books, not e-books."\n\nLet me click the "More" button to see if there are additional comments.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'target\': \'More button\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nThe page looks the same.

I need to carefully count all comments that have more downvotes than upvotes. Let me scroll back to the beginning.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'direction\': \'up\', \'distance\': \'long\'}\n[result] Scrolled up by long distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood, I\'m back in the middle of the comments. Let me continue scrolling up to get to the very beginning.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'direction\': \'up\', \'distance\': \'long\'}\n[result] Scrolled up by long distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nLet me scroll up one more time to see the very first comments at the top of the page.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'direction\': \'up\', \'distance\': \'long\'}\n[result] Scrolled up by long distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nThe page doesn\'t seem to be scrolling up anymore. It looks like this might be the start of the loaded comments after clicking "More". Let me check if there are earlier comments by looking at the URL. I notice the URL has a timestamp parameter. Let me scroll to the very top of the page first to see if the initial comments are there.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'keys\': [\'home\']}\n[result] Keys pressed successfully\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\'}\n[result] {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI notice the URL shows we\'re viewing comments with a specific timestamp filter. The first two comments I saw earlier (with -2 upvotes and the "My vote is for Bodhe" comment) are missing from this view. Let me navigate back to the comments page without the timestamp filter to see all comments from the beginning.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'target\': \'Comments tab\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nThe URL still has the timestamp filter. Let me click on the username "mineihussdon" in the profile box on the right to navigate back to the clean profile page.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'target\': \'mineihussdon username in the profile box on the right side\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect! Now I\'m back on the clean profile page and I can see the first comment with **-2** score (which means it has more downvotes than upvotes). Now let me click on the Comments tab to see all comments in a clean list.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'target\': \'Comments tab\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI notice I\'m now on the Overview tab, not the Comments tab. I can see the first comment at the top with **-2** upvotes (meaning it has more downvotes than upvotes). Let me click on the Comments tab which should be next to Overview.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'target\': \'Comments tab link next to Overview\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect! Now I\'m on the Comments tab with all comments listed. I can see the first comment at the top has **-2** (net score showing more downvotes than upvotes). Now let me systematically go through all comments by scrolling down and counting those with more downvotes than upvotes. \n\nBased on what I can see:\n1. First comment: **-2** - "Hi" (MORE DOWNVOTES THAN UPVOTES - COUNT: 1)\n2. Second: 1 upvote, 0 downvotes - "My vote is for Bodhe"\n3. Third: 1 upvote, 0 downvotes - "This is a great question!"\n4. Fourth: 5 upvotes, 0 downvotes - "That\'s fair."\n5. Fifth: 1 upvote, 0 downvotes - "I was thinking about that."\n6. Sixth: 2 upvotes, 0 downvotes - "Good suggestion! Thank you!"\n\nLet me scroll down to see all remaining comments.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'direction\': \'down\', \'distance\': \'long\'}\n[result] Scrolled down by long distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI can see more comments.

I notice one comment with 2 upvotes ("I completely agree. And I miss actual books, not e-books.").

I\'ve reached the end of the comments list. Now let me count all the comments I\'ve seen throughout my scrolling.\n\nBased on my complete review of all the comments, I found that **only 1 comment** has more downvotes than upvotes:\n\nThe first comment with a score of **-2** (meaning it has 2 net downvotes compared to upvotes) with the text "Hi"\n\nAll other comments either have:\n- Positive scores (1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 upvotes with 0 downvotes)\n- Zero score (0 upvotes and 0 downvotes)\n\nNone of the other comments showed more downvotes than upvotes. A score of 0 means equal upvotes and downvotes (or no votes at all), which doesn\'t qualify as "more downvotes than upvotes."\n[tool] mcp__task-completion__complete_task: {\'finalAnswer\': \'1\'}\n[complete] 1\nThe answer is **1**.\n\nThe user who made the latest post on the Worcester forum is **mineihussdon**, and they have **1 comment** that has received more downvotes than upvotes - the comment that says "Hi" with a score of -2.'}</pre></div><div class='parsed_action' style='background-color:yellow'><pre>stop [1]</pre></div></div>
