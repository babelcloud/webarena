Good! I can see I'm already on the "One Stop Market" website (the test e-commerce platform). I can see the homepage with various product categories at the top, including "Beauty & Personal Care" which is exactly what I need.

My task is to:
1. Navigate to Beauty & Personal Care category
2. Find the highest rated product within that category
3. Ensure the product is under $20
4. Purchase it

Let me click on the "Beauty & Personal Care" category to see the products available.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'Beauty & Personal Care category link in the top navigation menu'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I've navigated to the Beauty & Personal Care category page. The URL confirms I'm on the right page (beauty-personal-care.html). However, the page appears to be loading or mostly blank. Let me wait a moment for it to load completely, then take another screenshot.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! The page has loaded and I can see the Beauty & Personal Care category with many products. I can see:
- There are 21,796 items total in this category
- I can see several products with prices
- There's a "Sort By" dropdown currently set to "Position"

To find the highest rated product efficiently, I should sort by rating. Let me click on the "Sort By" dropdown and select an option to sort by customer rating/reviews.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'Sort By dropdown menu showing Position'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Great! The dropdown menu has opened and I can see the sorting options:
- Position (currently selected)
- Product Name
- Price

I don't see a direct "Rating" or "Reviews" option in this dropdown. Let me scroll down to see if there are more sorting options, or I may need to use a different approach. Let me first check if there are more options by scrolling within the dropdown or looking at the page more carefully.

Since I don't see a rating sort option, let me try using the price filter on the left to narrow down to products under $20, and then manually look for the highest rated ones. Let me click on the price range "$0.00 - $999.99" to see products in that range.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': '$0.00 - $999.99 price filter link on the left sidebar'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the URL changed to include a price filter. However, I realize I need to be more strategic here. Since there are 21,796 items and I need to find the highest rated product under $20, let me use the Advanced Search feature to filter more effectively. But first, let me scroll down on this page to see if I can spot any products with visible ratings, or I should look for a better filtering approach.

Let me scroll down to see more products and check if any have star ratings displayed.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! Now I can see more products and I notice that some products DO have star ratings displayed. I can see:
- "Mineralogie All Natural Lip Gloss, Ruby Rose" has 3 Reviews with 4 stars shown, priced at $20.00

However, this is exactly at my $20 budget limit, and I need to find products UNDER $20. Let me continue scrolling to see more products with ratings and find ones that are under $20.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! I found a product with visible ratings:
- "Petansy 3 Packs Aloe Vera Lipstick" has 12 Reviews with 3.5 stars, priced at $13.89 (under $20)

I can see this is the first page (pagination shows 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 at the bottom). However, I need to find the HIGHEST rated product. Looking at what I've seen so far, I have limited data. Since there's no sort by rating option, I'll need to use the Advanced Search to be more systematic.

Let me scroll back to the top and use the Advanced Search feature to search for products with high ratings and filter by price under $20.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'long'}
[result] Scrolled up by long distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good, I can now see the product listings again. I can see the "Mineralogie All Natural Lip Gloss, Ruby Rose" with 3 Reviews and 4 stars for $20.00 (which is at my limit, not under).

Looking at the current visible products with ratings:
- Mineralogie All Natural Lip Gloss: 4 stars, 3 Reviews, $20.00 (at limit)
- Petansy 3 Packs Aloe Vera Lipstick: 3.5 stars, 12 Reviews, $13.89 (under $20)

Since I need to systematically find the HIGHEST rated product under $20 from 21,796 items, let me scroll back up to use the Advanced Search feature. This will be much more efficient.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'long'}
[result] Scrolled up by long distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I'm back at the top of the page. I can see the "Advanced Search" link in the top right corner. Let me click on it to access more advanced filtering options that might help me find the highest rated products.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'Advanced Search link in the top right area below the search bar'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I notice the URL changed to "catalogsearch/advanced/" but the page still looks the same. The Advanced Search page may not have loaded properly. Let me wait a moment and then scroll down to see if there's an advanced search form below.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'duration': 1500}
[result] Finished waiting for 1500ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Great! Now I can see the Advanced Search page with search fields. I can see:
- Product Name
- SKU
- Description
- Short Description
- Price (with two fields for range)

Unfortunately, I don't see a field for filtering by rating/reviews. However, I can use the Price field to filter products under $20. Let me scroll down to see if there are more fields below, including category selection.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see this is all the Advanced Search has to offer - there's no rating filter or category selector here. The Advanced Search doesn't seem to have the functionality I need.

Since there's no rating sort option or advanced rating filter, I'll need to take a different approach. Let me go back to the Beauty & Personal Care category and manually browse through multiple pages to identify products with high ratings. Let me click on "Beauty & Personal Care" category again.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'Beauty & Personal Care category link in the top navigation menu'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The page is loading. Let me wait for it to fully load.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'duration': 2000}

Good! I'm back on the Beauty & Personal Care category page. Now I need to think strategically. With 21,796 items and no rating sort option, I need to be more efficient. Let me look more carefully at the visible products and then check multiple pages systematically. 

Looking at the current page, I can see products but most don't show ratings. Let me scroll down to look for products with visible star ratings and note the highest rated ones under $20.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see products with ratings now:
- "Mineralogie All Natural Lip Gloss, Ruby Rose" - 4 stars, 3 Reviews, $20.00 (at budget limit, not under)

Let me continue scrolling to see more products and their ratings.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I can see another product with ratings:
- "Petansy 3 Packs Aloe Vera Lipstick" - 3.5 stars, 12 Reviews, $13.89 (under $20)

So far on this first page, I've found:
1. Mineralogie Lip Gloss - 4 stars, $20.00 (at limit)
2. Petansy Lipstick - 3.5 stars, $13.89 (under $20)

I can see this is showing 12 items per page. To find the highest rated product systematically, let me change the "Show" dropdown to display more items per page so I can see more products at once. Let me click on the "12" dropdown.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'Show 12 per page dropdown menu in the bottom right'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
It seems the dropdown didn't open. Let me scroll up a bit to see the dropdown better and try clicking on it again.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'long'}
[result] Scrolled up by long distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I can see the product with 4 stars again - "Mineralogie All Natural Lip Gloss, Ruby Rose" with 3 Reviews at $20.00. Since this is exactly at my budget limit and not "under $20", I need to find something cheaper with a high rating.

Given the large number of items (21,796), let me try a different approach. Let me look for specific highly-rated subcategories that might have better products. I notice on the left sidebar there are categories. Let me scroll up to see the full category list and click on a specific subcategory that might have highly-rated products.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled up by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good, I'm back at the top. Looking at the current approach, with 21,796 items and no rating sort, I need to think more strategically. Let me try clicking on individual products that have visible star ratings to check their exact ratings and compare them. 

I notice the visible products on this page don't show star ratings in the grid view. However, I saw earlier that some products do show ratings when I scrolled down. Let me try a different strategy: I'll click on the "Mineralogie All Natural Lip Gloss, Ruby Rose" product (the 4-star one I saw) to check if there's a 5-star product option or to verify its exact rating, then I can search for similar highly-rated products.

But wait - that product is $20.00, which is at my limit. Let me scroll down and click on the Petansy Lipstick product (3.5 stars, $13.89) to see its details and look for related products or similar items that might have higher ratings.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I can see the Mineralogie lip gloss with 4 stars (3 Reviews) at $20.00. Let me continue scrolling to see the Petansy lipstick and check other products for their ratings.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'short'}
[result] Scrolled down by short distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! Now I can see the Petansy lipstick with 3.5 stars (12 Reviews) at $13.89. 

So far on page 1, I've found:
- Mineralogie Lip Gloss: 4 stars, 3 Reviews, $20.00 (at limit, not under)
- Petansy Lipstick: 3.5 stars, 12 Reviews, $13.89 (under $20)

Since I need to find the HIGHEST rated product under $20, and I've only checked 12 items out of 21,796, I should check more pages. Let me click on page 2 to see more products.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'page 2 button in the pagination at the bottom'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the URL has changed to include "p=2" (page 2) but the page is still showing the same products. Let me wait for the page to load properly.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! Now I'm on page 2 (items 13-24 of 21,796). I can see a new product with a rating:
- "Avocado Oil Natural Carrier Oil" - 4.5 stars, 6 Reviews, $12.49 (under $20)

This is promising! A 4.5-star rating is higher than the 3.5-star Petansy lipstick I found earlier. Let me scroll down to see all products on this page and check for any higher ratings.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see another product with ratings:
- "24K Gold Bio Collagen Crystal Lip Mask" - 1.5 stars, 3 Reviews, $8.99 (low rating)

Let me continue scrolling to see the rest of page 2.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the rest of page 2 products, but none of them show star ratings on this screen. I can see:
- IT Cosmetics Confidence: $7.97 (no visible rating)
- Helan Anti-cellulite: $56.00 (above budget)
- Givenchy Dahlia: $52.33 (above budget)
- MINGMIN-DZ Hair Cutting Scissors: $41.20 (above budget)

So far, the best product I've found under $20 is:
- **Avocado Oil Natural Carrier Oil: 4.5 stars, 6 Reviews, $12.49**

However, with 21,796 products, there might be 5-star products I haven't seen yet. Let me check a few more pages to look for 5-star products. Let me click on page 3.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'page 3 button in the pagination'}

I can see the URL changed to "p=3" but the page is still showing page 2 content. Let me wait for it to load.

Good! Now I'm on page 3 (items 25-36 of 21,796). I can see:
- Manuka Honey Cream Face Moisturizer: $23.97 (above budget)
- LSZ Bath Brush 3pcs: $46.88 (above budget)
- Ohora Base Nail Care Set: $42.58 (above budget)
- Daisy Scrub Hats: $8.99 (no visible rating)

None of these show visible ratings. Let me scroll down to see the rest of this page.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! I found more products with ratings:
- "Dark and Lovely Healthy-Gloss 5 Shea Moisture No-Lye Relaxer Kit": 3 stars, 2 Reviews, $19.41 (under $20)
- **"Roasemal Back Scrubber for Shower, Silicone Back Scrubber": 5 stars, 5 Reviews, $6.99 (under $20)**

This is perfect! I found a 5-star product under $20! The Roasemal Back Scrubber has 5 stars, 5 reviews, and costs only $6.99. This appears to be the highest possible rating. Let me verify this is indeed a 5-star product and then proceed to purchase it.

Let me click on this product to confirm its details before purchasing.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'Roasemal Back Scrubber for Shower product with 5 stars and purple silicone scrubber image'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}

[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I can now see the product details clearly:

**Product: Roasemal Back Scrubber for Shower, Silicone Back Scrubber for Shower, Dual Sided Natural Soft and Stiff Massage Bristles for Body Exfoliating(Purple)**

- **Rating: 5 stars (100% filled stars)**
- **Reviews: 5 Reviews**
- **Price: $6.99**
- **Status: IN STOCK**
- **Category: Beauty & Personal Care** ✓

This is exactly what I need! It's a 5-star rated product (the highest possible rating), it's under $20 ($6.99), and it's in the Beauty & Personal Care category. Now I need to add it to cart and complete the purchase.

Let me click "Add to Cart".
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'Add to Cart button'}

I can see that I need to select a color first - there's a red message "This is a required field." under the color options. I need to select a color before I can add it to the cart. Let me select Purple (which matches the default product shown).
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'Purple color radio button option'}

I can see the page still shows the same state. The error message is still there. Let me scroll down a bit to see the color options better and click on the Purple radio button more precisely.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'short'}

I've scrolled down and can see the product description section. I need to scroll back up to where the color selection and "Add to Cart" button are located so I can properly select a color and add the item to cart.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'medium'}

Perfect! Now I can see the color selection area clearly. I can see the radio buttons for:
- Blue
- Green  
- Pink
- Purple

And the error message "This is a required field." in red. Let me click on the radio button next to "Purple".
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'radio button circle to the left of the text Purple'}

[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'Add to Cart blue button'}

Let me scroll down to see if there are more sorting options, or I may need to use a different approach. Let me first check if there are more options by scrolling within the dropdown or looking at the page more carefully.\n\nSince I don\'t see a rating sort option, let me try using the price filter on the left to narrow down to products under $20, and then manually look for the highest rated ones.

However, I need to find the HIGHEST rated product. Looking at what I\'ve seen so far, I have limited data. Since there\'s no sort by rating option, I\'ll need to use the Advanced Search to be more systematic.\n\nLet me scroll back to the top and use the Advanced Search feature to search for products with high ratings and filter by price under $20.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c\', \'direction\': \'up\', \'distance\': \'long\'}\n[result] Scrolled up by long distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood, I can now see the product listings again.

Now I can see the Advanced Search page with search fields. I can see:\n- Product Name\n- SKU\n- Description\n- Short Description\n- Price (with two fields for range)\n\nUnfortunately, I don\'t see a field for filtering by rating/reviews. However, I can use the Price field to filter products under $20.

The Advanced Search doesn\'t seem to have the functionality I need.\n\nSince there\'s no rating sort option or advanced rating filter, I\'ll need to take a different approach. Let me go back to the Beauty & Personal Care category and manually browse through multiple pages to identify products with high ratings. Let me click on "Beauty & Personal Care" category again.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c\', \'target\': \'Beauty & Personal Care category link in the top navigation menu\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nThe page is loading.

I\'m back on the Beauty & Personal Care category page. Now I need to think strategically. With 21,796 items and no rating sort option, I need to be more efficient. Let me look more carefully at the visible products and then check multiple pages systematically. \n\nLooking at the current page, I can see products but most don\'t show ratings. Let me scroll down to look for products with visible star ratings and note the highest rated ones under $20.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c\', \'direction\': \'down\', \'distance\': \'medium\'}\n[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI can see products with ratings now:\n- "Mineralogie All Natural Lip Gloss, Ruby Rose" - 4 stars, 3 Reviews, $20.00 (at budget limit, not under)\n\nLet me continue scrolling to see more products and their ratings.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c\', \'direction\': \'down\', \'distance\': \'medium\'}\n[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect! Now I can see another product with ratings:\n- "Petansy 3 Packs Aloe Vera Lipstick" - 3.5 stars, 12 Reviews, $13.89 (under $20)\n\nSo far on this first page, I\'ve found:\n1. Mineralogie Lip Gloss - 4 stars, $20.00 (at limit)\n2. Petansy Lipstick - 3.5 stars, $13.89 (under $20)\n\nI can see this is showing 12 items per page. To find the highest rated product systematically, let me change the "Show" dropdown to display more items per page so I can see more products at once. Let me click on the "12" dropdown.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c\', \'target\': \'Show 12 per page dropdown menu in the bottom right\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nIt seems the dropdown didn\'t open.

I can see the product with 4 stars again - "Mineralogie All Natural Lip Gloss, Ruby Rose" with 3 Reviews at $20.00. Since this is exactly at my budget limit and not "under $20", I need to find something cheaper with a high rating.\n\nGiven the large number of items (21,796), let me try a different approach. Let me look for specific highly-rated subcategories that might have better products. I notice on the left sidebar there are categories. Let me scroll up to see the full category list and click on a specific subcategory that might have highly-rated products.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c\', \'direction\': \'up\', \'distance\': \'medium\'}\n[result] Scrolled up by medium distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood, I\'m back at the top. Looking at the current approach, with 21,796 items and no rating sort, I need to think more strategically. Let me try clicking on individual products that have visible star ratings to check their exact ratings and compare them. \n\nI notice the visible products on this page don\'t show star ratings in the grid view. However, I saw earlier that some products do show ratings when I scrolled down. Let me try a different strategy: I\'ll click on the "Mineralogie All Natural Lip Gloss, Ruby Rose" product (the 4-star one I saw) to check if there\'s a 5-star product option or to verify its exact rating, then I can search for similar highly-rated products.\n\nBut wait - that product is $20.00, which is at my limit. Let me scroll down and click on the Petansy Lipstick product (3.5 stars, $13.89) to see its details and look for related products or similar items that might have higher ratings.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c\', \'direction\': \'down\', \'distance\': \'medium\'}\n[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect! I can see the Mineralogie lip gloss with 4 stars (3 Reviews) at $20.00. Let me continue scrolling to see the Petansy lipstick and check other products for their ratings.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c\', \'direction\': \'down\', \'distance\': \'short\'}\n[result] Scrolled down by short distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood! Now I can see the Petansy lipstick with 3.5 stars (12 Reviews) at $13.89. \n\nSo far on page 1, I\'ve found:\n- Mineralogie Lip Gloss: 4 stars, 3 Reviews, $20.00 (at limit, not under)\n- Petansy Lipstick: 3.5 stars, 12 Reviews, $13.89 (under $20)\n\nSince I need to find the HIGHEST rated product under $20, and I\'ve only checked 12 items out of 21,796, I should check more pages.

Now I\'m on page 2 (items 13-24 of 21,796). I can see a new product with a rating:\n- "Avocado Oil Natural Carrier Oil" - 4.5 stars, 6 Reviews, $12.49 (under $20)\n\nThis is promising! A 4.5-star rating is higher than the 3.5-star Petansy lipstick I found earlier.
