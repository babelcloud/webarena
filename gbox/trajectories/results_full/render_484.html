Good! I can see I'm already on a GitLab page showing a list of projects. The task is to invite Jakub Klinkovský as a guest to a repo related to dotfile configurations. I need to find the dotfile configuration repository in this list. Let me scroll down to see if there's a dotfiles repository.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I found the "dotfiles" repository. I can see "Byte Blaze / dotfiles" with the description "Computer setup" and it was updated 7 minutes ago. Now I need to click on this repository to access it and then invite Jakub Klinkovský as a guest.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'Byte Blaze / dotfiles link with Computer setup description'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I see the page is loading. Let me wait a moment for it to fully load and then take a screenshot to see the dotfiles repository page.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I'm now on the dotfiles repository page. I can see the repository details and the left sidebar with various options. To invite Jakub Klinkovský as a guest, I need to access the project members/settings. I can see "Settings" in the left sidebar. Let me click on it.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'Settings link in the left sidebar'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Great! I can see a settings dropdown menu has appeared with various options. To invite a user as a guest, I typically need to access the "Members" section which isn't visible in this menu. In GitLab, member management is usually under a separate "Members" or "Project information" section. Let me scroll down in this settings menu to see if there are more options, or I'll need to look for a Members option elsewhere.

Let me click on "General" first to see what options are available there.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'General option in the settings menu'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I'm now in the General Settings page. This shows project naming, topics, and other general settings. However, to invite members, I need to find the Members section. In GitLab, the Members option is typically in the left sidebar, not under Settings. Let me scroll down on the left sidebar to see if there's a "Members" option below the current visible items.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'short'}
[result] Scrolled down by short distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see more settings options, but I need to find the Members section. Let me scroll up on the left sidebar to see all the main navigation options. The Members option should be in the main left sidebar, not under Settings.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled up by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good, I'm back in the main view. I can see the left sidebar clearly. I need to look for a "Members" option in the main navigation. Looking at the sidebar, I can see options like Project information, Repository, Issues, Merge requests, CI/CD, Security & Compliance, Deployments, etc. Let me check if "Project information" might contain member management options. Let me click on "Project information".
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'Project information link in the left sidebar'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I can see a dropdown menu has appeared under "Project information" with three options: Activity, Labels, and **Members**. This is exactly what I need! Let me click on "Members".
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'Members option in the Project information submenu'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I notice I'm now on the Activity page instead of the Members page. The URL shows "project_members" but the content is showing activity feed. Let me scroll down to see if there's more content or if I need to navigate differently. Let me take a screenshot to see the current state more clearly.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'duration': 1000}
[result] Finished waiting for 1000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I'm on the Project members page. I can see:
- A heading "Project members" 
- Text saying "You can invite a new member to dotfiles or invite another group."
- An "Invite members" button in the top right
- A list of 4 current members including Abishek S, Byte Blaze (Owner), Koushik Dutta, and yjlou

I need to click on the "Invite members" button to invite Jakub Klinkovský as a guest.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'Invite members button in the top right corner'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! A modal dialog has appeared titled "Invite members". I can see:
- A text field for "Username or email address"
- A dropdown for "Select a role" which is currently set to "Guest" (Perfect! This is exactly what I need)
- An optional "Access expiration date" field
- "Cancel" and "Invite" buttons

The role is already set to "Guest" which is what the task requires. Now I need to type "Jakub Klinkovský" in the username/email field. Let me click on the input field and type the name.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'Username or email address input field'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! The input field is now focused (I can see the blue border around it). Now I'll type "Jakub Klinkovský" in this field.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'content': 'Jakub Klinkovský', 'pressEnterAfterType': False}
[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! The system has found the user and is showing a dropdown suggestion with "Jakub Klinkovský" and the username "fahwaaaz". I need to click on this suggestion to select the user.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'Jakub Klinkovský fahwaaaz dropdown option'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! The user "Jakub Klinkovský" has been selected and now appears as a tag in the input field. I can see:
- The username is selected with an "X" to remove if needed
- The role is set to "Guest" (exactly what we need)
- The "Invite" button is ready to be clicked

Now I need to click the "Invite" button to complete the invitation.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'Invite button in the modal dialog'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the page is processing (there's a loading indicator in the browser tab). Let me wait a moment for the invitation to complete and then take a screenshot to verify the result.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! The task has been completed successfully! I can see:

1. A success message at the top: "Members were successfully added"
2. The member count has increased from 4 to 5 members
3. **Jakub Klinkovský (@fahwaaacz)** is now listed in the members table with:
   - Role: **Guest** (exactly as requested)
   - Access granted: "just now by Byte Blaze"
   - Source: Direct member

The invitation has been successfully completed. Jakub Klinkovský has been invited to the dotfiles repository as a guest.
[tool] mcp__task-completion__complete_task: {'finalAnswer': 'Successfully invited Jakub Klinkovský to the dotfiles repository as a guest. The invitation was completed and he now appears in the project members list with Guest role privileges.'}
