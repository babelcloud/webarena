Good! I can see a GitLab instance with several projects. I can see "a11y-webring.club" in the project list (second item: "Byte Blaze / a11y-webring.club"). I need to click on this project to access it and then look for commit information for Steven Woodson on 2/6/2023.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'a11y-webring.club project link in the second row of the projects list'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the URL has changed to include `/byteblaze/a11y-webring.club` but I'm still on the projects list page. Let me wait a moment for the page to load properly.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I'm now on the a11y-webring.club project page. I can see it has 235 Commits. I need to access the commits section to find the commits made by Steven Woodson on 2/6/2023. Let me click on the "235 Commits" link.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': '235 Commits link near the project statistics'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the page is loading (there's a loading indicator at the top). The URL at the bottom shows it's navigating to the commits page. Let me wait for it to fully load.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! I'm now on the commits page. I can see commits from March 2023, February 2023, etc. I need to find commits from 2/6/2023 (February 6, 2023) by Steven Woodson. I can see there are date groupings like "12 Mar, 2023", "09 Mar, 2023", "01 Mar, 2023", "28 Feb, 2023", "27 Feb, 2023", and "26 Feb, 2023". 

I notice there's an "Author" dropdown filter at the top that I can use to filter by author. This would be much more efficient than scrolling through all commits. Let me click on the "Author" dropdown to filter by Steven Woodson.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'Author dropdown button near the top of the commits list'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! The author dropdown is now open. I can see a search field and currently only "Byte Blaze byteblaze" is visible. I need to search for "Steven Woodson" in this search field. Let me type in the search box.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__type: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'content': 'Steven Woodson'}
[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the page has changed and I'm now viewing commits from February 2023. I notice the search bar at the top shows "on" which suggests my typing went to the GitLab search bar instead of the author dropdown. The dropdown seems to have closed. 

I can see commits from various dates in February 2023, including "26 Feb, 2023", "25 Feb, 2023", "18 Feb, 2023", "13 Feb, 2023", "12 Feb, 2023", and "11 Feb, 2023". I need to scroll down to find February 6, 2023 (06 Feb, 2023). Let me scroll down to see more commits.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
It looks like I'm now on a file search page showing the repository files. The URL has changed to `/find_file/main`. This happened because my search text went into the main GitLab search bar. Let me go back to the commits page by clicking on "Commits" in the left sidebar.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'Commits link in the left sidebar under Repository section'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the "Commits" link is now highlighted in the sidebar. Let me wait for the page to load.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I'm back on the commits page. Now I need to scroll down to find commits from February 6, 2023. I can see dates like "28 Feb, 2023", "27 Feb, 2023", and "26 Feb, 2023". I need to continue scrolling to find "06 Feb, 2023". Let me scroll down.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'long'}
[result] Scrolled down by long distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good progress! I can see commits from "25 Feb, 2023", "18 Feb, 2023", "13 Feb, 2023", "12 Feb, 2023", and "11 Feb, 2023". I need to continue scrolling to find "06 Feb, 2023". Let me scroll down more.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'long'}
[result] Scrolled down by long distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I found it! I can see "06 Feb, 2023 13 commits" which indicates there were 13 commits on February 6, 2023. Now I need to identify which of these commits were made by Steven Woodson. I can already see some commits by Steven Woodson on this screen:

1. "60: Added included files to the Netlify toml config so it's accessible to Netlify at build time" - Steve Woodson authored 2 years ago
2. "Swap to a relative file path" - Steven Woodson authored 2 years ago
3. "Attempting a different folder path, Netlify error" - Steven Woodson authored 2 years ago (appears twice at the bottom)

Let me scroll down a bit to see all 13 commits from February 6, 2023 to count how many were by Steven Woodson.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! Now I can see more commits. I can see "05 Feb, 2023 9 commits" at the top, which means I've moved past the February 6, 2023 section. I can see two more Steve Woodson commits in the visible area:

4. "60: Trying the member gathering without importing glob because Netlify..." - Steve Woodson authored 2 years ago
5. "#60: Adding sort by date to the new members array as well" - Steve Woodson authored 2 years ago  
6. "#60: Bugfix - Neglected to update the Netlify functions that relied on the..." - Steve Woodson authored 2 years ago

But I need to go back up to see all the commits from February 6, 2023 clearly. Let me scroll up a bit to get a better view of all the February 6 commits.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'short'}
[result] Scrolled up by short distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I have a better view. I can see "06 Feb, 2023 13 commits" and I can now count the Steven Woodson commits visible on this screen:

1. "60: Added included files to the Netlify toml config so it's accessible to Netlify at build time" - Steve Woodson
2. "Swap to a relative file path" - Steven Woodson
3. "Attempting a different folder path, Netlify error" - Steven Woodson (appears twice)

Let me scroll down just slightly to see if there are more Steven Woodson commits in the February 6 section.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'tiny'}
[result] Scrolled down by tiny distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! Now I can see the transition point. I can see "05 Feb, 2023 9 commits" which marks the end of the February 6 commits. Let me count all the Steven Woodson commits from February 6, 2023 that are visible:

From the February 6, 2023 section (above "05 Feb, 2023 9 commits"):
1. "60: Added included files to the Netlify toml config so it's accessible to Netlify at build time" - Steve Woodson
2. "Swap to a relative file path" - Steven Woodson
3. "Attempting a different folder path, Netlify error" - Steven Woodson (1st occurrence)
4. "Attempting a different folder path, Netlify error" - Steven Woodson (2nd occurrence)
5. "60: Trying the member gathering without importing glob because Netlify..." - Steve Woodson

Now I can see below "05 Feb, 2023" there are more Steve Woodson commits, but those are from February 5, not February 6. Let me scroll up slightly to make sure I see all the February 6 commits clearly.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'short'}
[result] Scrolled up by short distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! Now I can see the full "06 Feb, 2023 13 commits" section starting from the middle of the screen. I can see:

From February 6, 2023:
1. "Remove Winnie Magoma (#82)" - Eric Bailey
2. "Move Winnie to `removed/`" - Eric Bailey
3. "Add Darin Senneff (#78)" - Eric Bailey
4. "Merge branch 'main' into main" - Eric Bailey
5. "Netlify Functions build fix for #60 (#81)" - Eric Bailey
6. "Merge branch 'main' into main" - Eric Bailey

And the list continues below. Let me scroll down slowly to see all 13 commits and count the Steven Woodson ones.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'tiny'}
[result] Scrolled down by tiny distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I can see all the commits from "06 Feb, 2023 13 commits" until "05 Feb, 2023 9 commits". Let me count all the Steven Woodson commits from February 6, 2023:

From the visible list under "06 Feb, 2023 13 commits":
1. "Remove Winnie Magoma (#82)" - Eric Bailey
2. "Move Winnie to `removed/`" - Eric Bailey
3. "Add Darin Senneff (#78)" - Eric Bailey
4. "Merge branch 'main' into main" - Eric Bailey
5. "Netlify Functions build fix for #60 (#81)" - Eric Bailey
6. "Merge branch 'main' into main" - Eric Bailey
7. "60: Added included files to the Netlify toml config so it's accessible to Netlify at build time" - **Steve Woodson** ✓
8. "Swap to a relative file path" - **Steven Woodson** ✓
9. "Attempting a different folder path, Netlify error" - **Steven Woodson** ✓
10. "Attempting a different folder path, Netlify error" - **Steven Woodson** ✓
11. "60: Trying the member gathering without importing glob (#79)" - Eric Bailey
12. "Merge branch 'main' into main" - Eric Bailey
13. "60: Trying the member gathering without importing glob because Netlify..." - **Steve Woodson** ✓

That's 5 commits by Steven Woodson (note: "Steve Woodson" and "Steven Woodson" appear to be the same person based on the avatar). Let me verify this count is correct by checking if there are exactly 13 commits visible between the "06 Feb, 2023" header and the "05 Feb, 2023" header.

I can count: 13 commits total on February 6, 2023, and 5 of them are by Steven Woodson (Steve Woodson).

Let me wait for the page to load.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'duration\': 2000}\n[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood! I\'m back on the commits page. Now I need to scroll down to find commits from February 6, 2023. I can see dates like "28 Feb, 2023", "27 Feb, 2023", and "26 Feb, 2023". I need to continue scrolling to find "06 Feb, 2023". Let me scroll down.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'direction\': \'down\', \'distance\': \'long\'}\n[result] Scrolled down by long distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood progress! I can see commits from "25 Feb, 2023", "18 Feb, 2023", "13 Feb, 2023", "12 Feb, 2023", and "11 Feb, 2023". I need to continue scrolling to find "06 Feb, 2023". Let me scroll down more.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'direction\': \'down\', \'distance\': \'long\'}\n[result] Scrolled down by long distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect! I found it! I can see "06 Feb, 2023 13 commits" which indicates there were 13 commits on February 6, 2023. Now I need to identify which of these commits were made by Steven Woodson. I can already see some commits by Steven Woodson on this screen:\n\n1. "60: Added included files to the Netlify toml config so it\'s accessible to Netlify at build time" - Steve Woodson authored 2 years ago\n2. "Swap to a relative file path" - Steven Woodson authored 2 years ago\n3. "Attempting a different folder path, Netlify error" - Steven Woodson authored 2 years ago (appears twice at the bottom)\n\nLet me scroll down a bit to see all 13 commits from February 6, 2023 to count how many were by Steven Woodson.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'direction\': \'down\', \'distance\': \'medium\'}\n[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood! Now I can see more commits. I can see "05 Feb, 2023 9 commits" at the top, which means I\'ve moved past the February 6, 2023 section. I can see two more Steve Woodson commits in the visible area:\n\n4. "60: Trying the member gathering without importing glob because Netlify..." - Steve Woodson authored 2 years ago\n5. "#60: Adding sort by date to the new members array as well" - Steve Woodson authored 2 years ago  \n6. "#60: Bugfix - Neglected to update the Netlify functions that relied on the..." - Steve Woodson authored 2 years ago\n\nBut I need to go back up to see all the commits from February 6, 2023 clearly. Let me scroll up a bit to get a better view of all the February 6 commits.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'direction\': \'up\', \'distance\': \'short\'}\n[result] Scrolled up by short distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect! Now I have a better view. I can see "06 Feb, 2023 13 commits" and I can now count the Steven Woodson commits visible on this screen:\n\n1. "60: Added included files to the Netlify toml config so it\'s accessible to Netlify at build time" - Steve Woodson\n2. "Swap to a relative file path" - Steven Woodson\n3. "Attempting a different folder path, Netlify error" - Steven Woodson (appears twice)\n\nLet me scroll down just slightly to see if there are more Steven Woodson commits in the February 6 section.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'direction\': \'down\', \'distance\': \'tiny\'}\n[result] Scrolled down by tiny distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nExcellent! Now I can see the transition point. I can see "05 Feb, 2023 9 commits" which marks the end of the February 6 commits. Let me count all the Steven Woodson commits from February 6, 2023 that are visible:\n\nFrom the February 6, 2023 section (above "05 Feb, 2023 9 commits"):\n1. "60: Added included files to the Netlify toml config so it\'s accessible to Netlify at build time" - Steve Woodson\n2. "Swap to a relative file path" - Steven Woodson\n3. "Attempting a different folder path, Netlify error" - Steven Woodson (1st occurrence)\n4. "Attempting a different folder path, Netlify error" - Steven Woodson (2nd occurrence)\n5. "60: Trying the member gathering without importing glob because Netlify..." - Steve Woodson\n\nNow I can see below "05 Feb, 2023" there are more Steve Woodson commits, but those are from February 5, not February 6. Let me scroll up slightly to make sure I see all the February 6 commits clearly.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'direction\': \'up\', \'distance\': \'short\'}\n[result] Scrolled up by short distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood! Now I can see the full "06 Feb, 2023 13 commits" section starting from the middle of the screen. I can see:\n\nFrom February 6, 2023:\n1. "Remove Winnie Magoma (#82)" - Eric Bailey\n2. "Move Winnie to `removed/`" - Eric Bailey\n3. "Add Darin Senneff (#78)" - Eric Bailey\n4. "Merge branch \'main\' into main" - Eric Bailey\n5. "Netlify Functions build fix for #60 (#81)" - Eric Bailey\n6. "Merge branch \'main\' into main" - Eric Bailey\n\nAnd the list continues below. Let me scroll down slowly to see all 13 commits and count the Steven Woodson ones.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'direction\': \'down\', \'distance\': \'tiny\'}\n[result] Scrolled down by tiny distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect! Now I can see all the commits from "06 Feb, 2023 13 commits" until "05 Feb, 2023 9 commits". Let me count all the Steven Woodson commits from February 6, 2023:\n\nFrom the visible list under "06 Feb, 2023 13 commits":\n1. "Remove Winnie Magoma (#82)" - Eric Bailey\n2. "Move Winnie to `removed/`" - Eric Bailey\n3. "Add Darin Senneff (#78)" - Eric Bailey\n4. "Merge branch \'main\' into main" - Eric Bailey\n5. "Netlify Functions build fix for #60 (#81)" - Eric Bailey\n6. "Merge branch \'main\' into main" - Eric Bailey\n7. "60: Added included files to the Netlify toml config so it\'s accessible to Netlify at build time" - **Steve Woodson** ✓\n8. "Swap to a relative file path" - **Steven Woodson** ✓\n9. "Attempting a different folder path, Netlify error" - **Steven Woodson** ✓\n10. "Attempting a different folder path, Netlify error" - **Steven Woodson** ✓\n11. "60: Trying the member gathering without importing glob (#79)" - Eric Bailey\n12. "Merge branch \'main\' into main" - Eric Bailey\n13. "60: Trying the member gathering without importing glob because Netlify..." - **Steve Woodson** ✓\n\nThat\'s 5 commits by Steven Woodson (note: "Steve Woodson" and "Steven Woodson" appear to be the same person based on the avatar). Let me verify this count is correct by checking if there are exactly 13 commits visible between the "06 Feb, 2023" header and the "05 Feb, 2023" header.\n\nI can count: 13 commits total on February 6, 2023, and 5 of them are by Steven Woodson (Steve Woodson).\n[tool] mcp__task-completion__complete_task: {\'finalAnswer\': \'5\'}\n[complete] 5\nThe task is complete! Steven Woodson made **5 commits** to a11y-webring.club on February 6, 2023 (2/6/2023).'}</pre></div><div class='parsed_action' style='background-color:yellow'><pre>stop [5]</pre></div></div>
