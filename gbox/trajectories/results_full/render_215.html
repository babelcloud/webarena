The products displayed (Emma Leggings, Diana Tights, Dana Bikram Pant, etc.) don't match my search. Let me scroll down to see if there are more results, or perhaps I need to check if customer reviews are accessed differently in this admin panel.

Let me check the Marketing section or look for a Reviews section in the menu. Customer reviews might be under a different section.

Perfect! I can now see the full review for the "Circe Hooded Ice Fleece". This is review #353 by Hannah Lim with a 1-star rating (titled "Bad!"). The review states:

"I was really disappointed with the Circe Hooded Ice Fleece. The material is not very high quality and started pilling after just one wash. The fit was also really strange - the sleeves were too short and the body was too baggy, making me look frumpy. I was hoping this would be a cozy layer for winter walks, but it doesn't keep me very warm either. Finally, the hood is way too big and just falls down over my face. I wouldn't recommend this product - there are much better options out there for the price."

Now let me go back and check the second review (ID 352 - "Good but not perfect"). Let me click the "Next" button to see the next review.

Excellent! Now I can see the second review (ID 352) for the "Circe Hooded Ice Fleece". This is a 4-star review titled "Good but not perfect" by "customer". The review states:

"I recently purchased the Circe Hooded Ice Fleece and overall, I'm quite happy with it. The fleece material is incredibly soft and cozy, and I love the addition of the hood for extra warmth. The fit is true to size and the sleeves are long enough, which is often a problem for me. The only reason I'm not giving it a full 5 stars is because I was hoping the color would be a bit more vibrant - it's a bit muted compared to what I was expecting. But overall, I would definitely recommend the Circe Hooded Ice Fleece for anyone in need of a warm and comfortable layer for outdoor activities."

Now let me go back to the reviews list to see if there are any other reviews for the Circe ice fleece that I might have missed. Let me click "Back" to return to the reviews list.

Perfect! I'm back at the Reviews list. I can see there are only 2 reviews for "Circe Hooded Ice Fleece" (SKU: WH12):

1. **ID 353** - "Bad!" by Hannah Lim (1 star)
2. **ID 352** - "Good but not perfect" by customer (4 stars)

Based on the reviews I've read, I now have comprehensive information about what customers don't like about the Circe ice fleece. Let me compile this information and provide the final answer.

From the reviews, the key negative aspects mentioned by customers are:

**From the 1-star review (Hannah Lim - "Bad!"):**
- Material is not very high quality and started pilling after just one wash
- Strange fit: sleeves were too short and the body was too baggy, making her look frumpy
- Doesn't keep the wearer very warm
- Hood is way too big and falls down over the face

**From the 4-star review (customer - "Good but not perfect"):**
- The only complaint is that the color is a bit muted compared to what was expected (wanted more vibrant colors)

Now I'll provide the final answer.

I can now see the full review for the "Circe Hooded Ice Fleece". This is review #353 by Hannah Lim with a 1-star rating (titled "Bad!"). The review states:\n\n"I was really disappointed with the Circe Hooded Ice Fleece. The material is not very high quality and started pilling after just one wash. The fit was also really strange - the sleeves were too short and the body was too baggy, making me look frumpy. I was hoping this would be a cozy layer for winter walks, but it doesn\'t keep me very warm either. Finally, the hood is way too big and just falls down over my face. I wouldn\'t recommend this product - there are much better options out there for the price."\n\nNow let me go back and check the second review (ID 352 - "Good but not perfect").

The review states:\n\n"I recently purchased the Circe Hooded Ice Fleece and overall, I\'m quite happy with it. The fleece material is incredibly soft and cozy, and I love the addition of the hood for extra warmth. The fit is true to size and the sleeves are long enough, which is often a problem for me. The only reason I\'m not giving it a full 5 stars is because I was hoping the color would be a bit more vibrant - it\'s a bit muted compared to what I was expecting. But overall, I would definitely recommend the Circe Hooded Ice Fleece for anyone in need of a warm and comfortable layer for outdoor activities."\n\nNow let me go back to the reviews list to see if there are any other reviews for the Circe ice fleece that I might have missed.
