Good! I can see I'm on the "One Stop Market" e-commerce website. I can see there's a "My Account" link in the top right. To check my orders from the past three days (the task says today is 6/12/2023, so I need to check orders from 6/9/2023, 6/10/2023, 6/11/2023, and 6/12/2023), I need to access my account section. Let me click on "My Account".

Perfect! I'm now on the My Account page. I can see there's a "Recent Orders" section showing 2 orders:
- Order 000000170 from 5/17/23 - Status: Canceled - Total: $365.42
- Order 000000189 from 5/2/23 - Status: Pending - Total: $754.99

However, I need to see ALL orders, especially those from the past three days (June 9-12, 2023). I can see there's a "View All" link next to "Recent Orders". Let me click on "My Orders" in the left sidebar to see the complete order history.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'My Orders link in the left sidebar navigation'}

Excellent! I can now see the "My Orders" page. I can see orders listed with their dates, but I notice that:

1. The current visible orders are from February to May 2023
2. The task asks for orders from the past three days (June 9-12, 2023, since today is June 12, 2023)
3. There are 37 total orders shown at the bottom ("Items 1 to 10 of 37 total")
4. The most recent order shown is from 5/17/23

I need to scroll down or navigate through the pages to find orders from June 2023. Let me scroll down to see if there are more recent orders, or check if the orders are sorted in reverse chronological order. I should look at the pagination - I can see page numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 at the bottom. The orders might be sorted with oldest first, so I should go to the last page to find the most recent orders.

Let me click on page 4 to see the most recent orders.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'page number 4 link in the pagination section at the bottom'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I see the page is loading (URL shows ?p=4 at the bottom). Let me wait for it to load completely.

[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I'm now on page 4 showing items 31 to 37 of 37 total. I can see the orders are from 2022 (6/30/22, 5/22/22, 4/27/22, 4/5/22, 3/10/22, 3/2/22). This confirms the orders are sorted in descending order (newest first on page 1).

So the most recent orders should be on page 1. However, I noticed that on page 1, the most recent order was from 5/17/23, but I need orders from June 9-12, 2023. Let me go back to page 1 to check if I missed something, or if there might be a way to filter or search by date.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'page number 1 link in the pagination section'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Let me wait for the page to load fully.

[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I'm back on page 1. I can see the most recent order is from 5/17/23, but I need orders from June 9-12, 2023 (today is 6/12/2023 according to the task). 

The orders shown are:
- 5/17/23, 5/2/23 (multiple), 3/11/23, 3/10/23, 2/27/23, 2/24/23, 2/11/23, 2/9/23

There are no orders from June 2023 visible. This could mean:
1. There are no orders in the past 3 days (June 9-12, 2023)
2. The data might need to be refreshed
3. There might be pending orders that aren't shown yet

According to the instructions, "Sometimes the data on the website may not be updated so it is your job to ensure the data is up to date if there is an option to update." Let me scroll up to see if there's a refresh button or any way to update the order data. Let me also check if I can see the full page by scrolling.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'medium'}

[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the page clearly now. The most recent orders are from May 2023, but I need to find orders from June 9-12, 2023. Let me try refreshing the page to see if there are newer orders. I'll use the browser refresh function.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'keys': ['f5']}

The page has refreshed but still shows the same orders with the most recent being from 5/17/23. Looking at the task requirements, I need to find fulfilled orders from the past three days (June 9-12, 2023). 

Looking more carefully at the visible orders, I need to focus on:
1. Orders from June 9, 10, 11, and 12, 2023
2. Only "Complete" status orders (fulfilled)

From what I can see, there are NO orders from June 2023 displayed. The most recent is from 5/17/23. However, I notice the task says "Tell me how many fulfilled orders I have over the past three days". 

Let me think about this differently - maybe the "today" date in the system is not June 12, 2023, but rather based on what the actual latest order date is. Or perhaps there simply are no orders in that period.

But wait - let me look at the Status column more carefully for orders from the past. Looking at what's visible:
- From the past 3 days relative to June 12, 2023, I would need orders from 6/10, 6/11, and 6/12/2023
- There are no visible orders from June 2023 at all

Since there are no orders showing from June 2023, and the most recent order is from May 17, 2023, it appears there have been NO fulfilled orders in the past three days (June 9-12, 2023).

Let me verify by checking if perhaps the orders are sorted differently or if I need to look at a different section. Let me try clicking on the "Date" column header to see if I can sort by date.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Date column header in the orders table'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The page hasn't changed after clicking the Date header. It seems the column headers might not be sortable. Based on my thorough review of all the orders across all pages:

- Page 1: Orders from 5/17/23, 5/2/23, 3/11/23, 3/10/23, 2/27/23, 2/24/23, 2/11/23, 2/9/23
- Page 4: Orders from 6/30/22, 5/22/22, 4/27/22, 4/5/22, 3/10/22, 3/2/22

The most recent order in the system is from 5/17/23, and there are **NO orders from June 2023** at all. Since the task asks for fulfilled orders from the past three days (June 9-12, 2023), and there are no orders from that period, the answer would be:

**Number of fulfilled orders: 0**
**Total amount spent: $0.00**

However, let me double-check by looking at all pages to make absolutely certain. Let me check page 2 and 3 as well to be thorough.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'page number 2 link in the pagination'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Let me wait for page 2 to load.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'duration': 2000}
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86'}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! Now I'm on page 2 showing items 11 to 20 of 37 total. I can see orders from:
- 1/29/23, 1/16/23 (January 2023)
- 12/18/22, 12/14/22, 12/12/22, 12/4/22 (December 2022)
- 11/26/22, 11/20/22, 11/11/22 (November 2022)
- 10/22/22 (October 2022)

Still no orders from June 2023. Let me check page 3 to be absolutely thorough.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'page number 3 link in the pagination'}

[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86'}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Page 3 shows items 21 to 30 of 37 total. These orders are from 2022 (October, September, August, July). All orders from 2022.

I've now checked:
- Page 1: Most recent order is 5/17/23
- Page 2: Orders from January 2023 and late 2022
- Page 3: Orders from mid-2022
- Page 4: Orders from early 2022

After reviewing all 37 orders across all 4 pages, I can confirm there are **NO orders from June 2023** at all. The most recent order in the entire system is from May 17, 2023.

Since the task asks for fulfilled orders from the past three days (June 9-12, 2023) and there are no orders from that period, the answer is:

- **Number of fulfilled orders in the past three days: 0**
- **Total amount spent: $0.00**
[tool] mcp__task-completion__complete_task: {'finalAnswer': '0 fulfilled orders, $0.00 total spent'}
[complete] 0 fulfilled orders, $0.00 total spent
The task is complete. After thoroughly reviewing all 37 orders across all 4 pages of the order history, I found no orders from June 2023. The most recent order was from May 17, 2023. Therefore, for the past three days (June 9-12, 2023), there were **0 fulfilled orders** with a **total of $0.00 spent**.</pre></div><div class='action_object' style='background-color:grey'><pre>{'action_type': <ActionTypes.STOP: 17>, 'coords': array([0., 0.], dtype=float32), 'element_role': 0, 'element_name': '', 'text': [], 'page_number': 0, 'url': '', 'nth': 0, 'pw_code': '', 'element_id': '', 'key_comb': '', 'direction': '', 'answer': '0 fulfilled orders, $0.00 total spent', 'raw_prediction': 'I\'ll help you find your fulfilled orders over the past three days and calculate the total amount spent.

I can now see the "My Orders" page. I can see orders listed with their dates, but I notice that:\n\n1. The current visible orders are from February to May 2023\n2. The task asks for orders from the past three days (June 9-12, 2023, since today is June 12, 2023)\n3. There are 37 total orders shown at the bottom ("Items 1 to 10 of 37 total")\n4. The most recent order shown is from 5/17/23\n\nI need to scroll down or navigate through the pages to find orders from June 2023. Let me scroll down to see if there are more recent orders, or check if the orders are sorted in reverse chronological order. I should look at the pagination - I can see page numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 at the bottom. The orders might be sorted with oldest first, so I should go to the last page to find the most recent orders.\n\nLet me click on page 4 to see the most recent orders.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'target\': \'page number 4 link in the pagination section at the bottom\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI see the page is loading (URL shows ?p=4 at the bottom). Let me wait for it to load completely.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'duration\': 2000}\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\'}\n[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\n[result] {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood! I\'m now on page 4 showing items 31 to 37 of 37 total. I can see the orders are from 2022 (6/30/22, 5/22/22, 4/27/22, 4/5/22, 3/10/22, 3/2/22). This confirms the orders are sorted in descending order (newest first on page 1).\n\nSo the most recent orders should be on page 1. However, I noticed that on page 1, the most recent order was from 5/17/23, but I need orders from June 9-12, 2023. Let me go back to page 1 to check if I missed something, or if there might be a way to filter or search by date.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'target\': \'page number 1 link in the pagination section\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nLet me wait for the page to load fully.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'duration\': 2000}\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\'}\n[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\n[result] {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI\'m back on page 1. I can see the most recent order is from 5/17/23, but I need orders from June 9-12, 2023 (today is 6/12/2023 according to the task). \n\nThe orders shown are:\n- 5/17/23, 5/2/23 (multiple), 3/11/23, 3/10/23, 2/27/23, 2/24/23, 2/11/23, 2/9/23\n\nThere are no orders from June 2023 visible. This could mean:\n1. There are no orders in the past 3 days (June 9-12, 2023)\n2. The data might need to be refreshed\n3. There might be pending orders that aren\'t shown yet\n\nAccording to the instructions, "Sometimes the data on the website may not be updated so it is your job to ensure the data is up to date if there is an option to update." Let me scroll up to see if there\'s a refresh button or any way to update the order data. Let me also check if I can see the full page by scrolling.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'direction\': \'up\', \'distance\': \'medium\'}\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\'}\n[result] Scrolled up by medium distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\n[result] {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI can see the page clearly now. The most recent orders are from May 2023, but I need to find orders from June 9-12, 2023. Let me try refreshing the page to see if there are newer orders. I\'ll use the browser refresh function.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'keys\': [\'f5\']}\n[result] Keys pressed successfully\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'duration\': 3000}\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\'}\n[result] Finished waiting for 3000ms. {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\n[result] {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nThe page has refreshed but still shows the same orders with the most recent being from 5/17/23. Looking at the task requirements, I need to find fulfilled orders from the past three days (June 9-12, 2023). \n\nLooking more carefully at the visible orders, I need to focus on:\n1. Orders from June 9, 10, 11, and 12, 2023\n2. Only "Complete" status orders (fulfilled)\n\nFrom what I can see, there are NO orders from June 2023 displayed. The most recent is from 5/17/23. However, I notice the task says "Tell me how many fulfilled orders I have over the past three days". \n\nLet me think about this differently - maybe the "today" date in the system is not June 12, 2023, but rather based on what the actual latest order date is. Or perhaps there simply are no orders in that period.\n\nBut wait - let me look at the Status column more carefully for orders from the past. Looking at what\'s visible:\n- From the past 3 days relative to June 12, 2023, I would need orders from 6/10, 6/11, and 6/12/2023\n- There are no visible orders from June 2023 at all\n\nSince there are no orders showing from June 2023, and the most recent order is from May 17, 2023, it appears there have been NO fulfilled orders in the past three days (June 9-12, 2023).\n\nLet me verify by checking if perhaps the orders are sorted differently or if I need to look at a different section. Let me try clicking on the "Date" column header to see if I can sort by date.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'target\': \'Date column header in the orders table\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nThe page hasn\'t changed after clicking the Date header. It seems the column headers might not be sortable. Based on my thorough review of all the orders across all pages:\n\n- Page 1: Orders from 5/17/23, 5/2/23, 3/11/23, 3/10/23, 2/27/23, 2/24/23, 2/11/23, 2/9/23\n- Page 4: Orders from 6/30/22, 5/22/22, 4/27/22, 4/5/22, 3/10/22, 3/2/22\n\nThe most recent order in the system is from 5/17/23, and there are **NO orders from June 2023** at all. Since the task asks for fulfilled orders from the past three days (June 9-12, 2023), and there are no orders from that period, the answer would be:\n\n**Number of fulfilled orders: 0**\n**Total amount spent: $0.00**\n\nHowever, let me double-check by looking at all pages to make absolutely certain. Let me check page 2 and 3 as well to be thorough.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'target\': \'page number 2 link in the pagination\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nLet me wait for page 2 to load.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'duration\': 2000}\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\'}\n[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\n[result] {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood!

I can see orders from:\n- 1/29/23, 1/16/23 (January 2023)\n- 12/18/22, 12/14/22, 12/12/22, 12/4/22 (December 2022)\n- 11/26/22, 11/20/22, 11/11/22 (November 2022)\n- 10/22/22 (October 2022)\n\nStill no orders from June 2023. Let me check page 3 to be absolutely thorough.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'target\': \'page number 3 link in the pagination\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'duration\': 2000}\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\'}\n[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\n[result] {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPage 3 shows items 21 to 30 of 37 total. These orders are from 2022 (October, September, August, July). All orders from 2022.\n\nI\'ve now checked:\n- Page 1: Most recent order is 5/17/23\n- Page 2: Orders from January 2023 and late 2022\n- Page 3: Orders from mid-2022\n- Page 4: Orders from early 2022\n\nAfter reviewing all 37 orders across all 4 pages, I can confirm there are **NO orders from June 2023** at all. The most recent order in the entire system is from May 17, 2023.\n\nSince the task asks for fulfilled orders from the past three days (June 9-12, 2023) and there are no orders from that period, the answer is:\n\n- **Number of fulfilled orders in the past three days: 0**\n- **Total amount spent: $0.00**\n[tool] mcp__task-completion__complete_task: {\'finalAnswer\': \'0 fulfilled orders, $0.00 total spent\'}\n[complete] 0 fulfilled orders, $0.00 total spent\nThe task is complete. After thoroughly reviewing all 37 orders across all 4 pages of the order history, I found no orders from June 2023. The most recent order was from May 17, 2023. Therefore, for the past three days (June 9-12, 2023), there were **0 fulfilled orders** with a **total of $0.00 spent**.'}</pre></div><div class='parsed_action' style='background-color:yellow'><pre>stop [0 fulfilled orders, $0.00 total spent]</pre></div></div>
