Good! I can see I'm on a GitLab dashboard with a list of projects. I need to find issues I've created with "feature" in the title. Let me look for the Issues section. I'll click on the menu icon or navigate to the Issues page.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'Menu icon (three horizontal lines) in the top left corner next to the GitLab logo'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the page is still the same. Let me try to access the Issues section through the top navigation. I'll look for an Issues link in the navigation bar or try to find it through a different approach. Let me check the top navigation icons more carefully.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'Issues icon in the top navigation bar (looks like an exclamation mark in a circle)'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I see a dropdown menu appeared with "Dashboard" option. Let me try a different approach. I'll look for the Issues section by clicking on the hamburger menu icon to see more navigation options.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'Three horizontal lines menu icon at the top left, next to the GitLab logo'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Great! I can see a menu opened with options including "Projects", "Groups", "Milestones", "Snippets", and "Activity". I don't see "Issues" in this menu directly, but let me scroll down in this menu to see if there are more options, or I can try clicking on "Activity" to see if that shows me my recent issues.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'short'}
[result] Scrolled down by short distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! The page scrolled down and I can see more projects. Let me close this menu and try a different approach. I'll look for the Issues section in the top navigation bar. Let me click elsewhere to close this menu first.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'keys': ['escape']}

Good! The menu is closed. Now I can see the projects list. I need to find the Issues section. In GitLab, I can access my issues through the user menu or by navigating to a specific URL. Let me try clicking on my user profile icon in the top right corner to see if there's an option to view my issues.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'User avatar icon in the top right corner of the navigation bar'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! A dropdown menu appeared showing "Byte Blaze (Busy)", "@byteblaze", "Out of Office", and options like "Edit status", "Edit profile", "Preferences", and "Sign out". This doesn't show an Issues link directly. Let me close this and try a different approach. I'll navigate directly to the issues page by modifying the URL or using the search bar to find issues. Let me press Escape to close this menu.

Good. Now let me try to navigate directly to the issues page. I'll click on the URL bar and type the issues URL. In GitLab, the issues dashboard is typically at `/dashboard/issues`. Let me click on the address bar.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'Address bar showing ec2-3-149-78-74.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8023'}

Excellent! The Issues page has loaded. I can see:
- A heading "Issues" at the top
- Three tabs: "Open", "Closed", "All" (currently on "Open" tab)
- A search/filter box that says "Search or filter results..."
- A message saying "Please select at least one filter to see results"
- A "Created date" dropdown on the right

I need to find issues I created that have "feature" in the title. Let me use the search box to search for "feature" and also ensure I'm filtering to show issues I created. Let me click on the search box first.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'Search or filter results input field'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! A dropdown menu appeared with filter options:
- Author
- Assignee
- Milestone
- Release
- Label
- My-Reaction

I need to filter by "Author" to see issues I created. Let me click on "Author".
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'Author option in the dropdown menu'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! The Author filter has been added to the search box. Now I see a dropdown with options:
- = (equals)
- is
- != (not equals)
- is not

I need to select "=" or "is" to specify that I'm the author. Let me click on "=" to set myself as the author.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': '= option in the dropdown'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! A list of users appeared. I can see:
- Byte Blaze (@byteblaze) - at the top
- And several other users below

Since I'm logged in as "Byte Blaze" (as I saw earlier in the profile menu), I should select "Byte Blaze" to filter for issues I created. Let me click on it.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'Byte Blaze @byteblaze option at the top of the user list'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! The filter now shows "Author = Byte Blaze" in the search box. However, I still see the message "Please select at least one filter to see results". It seems the filter hasn't been applied yet. Let me wait a moment for the page to load or I need to press Enter to apply the filter.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'keys': ['enter']}
[result] Keys pressed successfully
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! The filter has been applied and now I can see a list of issues I created. I can see at the top of the tabs:
- Open: 19
- Closed: 59
- All: 78

Looking at the visible issues, I can see several with "feature" in the title:
1. **[Feature suggestion] WCAG trash panda mode** - created 2 years ago, labels: "feature", "help wanted", updated 2 years ago
2. **[Feature suggestion] Add a submission form** - created 2 years ago, label: "feature", updated 2 years ago
3. **[Feature suggestion] Color theme slider** - created 2 years ago, labels: "feature", "help wanted", updated 2 years ago

The task asks me to find my **latest created issue that has feature in its title**. I need to check the "Created date" sorting to make sure I'm seeing them in the correct order. I can see the "Created date" dropdown on the right. Let me check if there are more recent issues by looking at the sort order. The top issue shows "created 2 years ago", but I need to verify this is sorted by creation date in descending order (newest first).

Let me click on the "Created date" dropdown to see the sorting options.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'Created date dropdown button on the right side of the page'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! A dropdown menu appeared showing sorting options:
- Priority
- **Created date** ✓ (currently selected)
- Closed date
- Updated date
- Milestone due date
- Due date
- Popularity
- Label priority
- Manual
- Title

Good! It's already sorted by "Created date". Now I need to check if it's sorting in descending order (newest first) or ascending order (oldest first). Looking at the issues, I see:
- First issue: created 2 years ago
- Second issue: created 2 years ago
- Fourth issue: created 3 years ago
- Fifth issue: created 3 years ago

This suggests it might be sorted with newest first. However, I need to click on the sort direction icon (the arrow) to ensure I'm seeing the newest issues first. Let me close this dropdown first and check the sort arrow.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'keys': ['escape']}
[result] Keys pressed successfully
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608'}
[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! Now I can see the list clearly. Looking at the issues with "feature" in the title, I see:
1. **[Feature suggestion] WCAG trash panda mode** - created 2 years ago
2. **[Feature suggestion] Add a submission form** - created 2 years ago  
3. **[Feature suggestion] Color theme slider** - created 2 years ago

I also notice there's an icon next to the "Created date" dropdown - it appears to be showing the sort direction. I can see there's a sort direction toggle button (two arrows icon) next to "Created date". The current sorting shows 2 years ago at the top, then 3 years, then 4 years, which means it's sorted newest first (descending order).

Based on what I can see, the three "Feature suggestion" issues at the top were all created "2 years ago". Since they all have the same creation time display, I need to click on the first one to check if it's closed. The task says "latest created issue that has feature in its title", so I should click on the **first** one: "[Feature suggestion] WCAG trash panda mode".

Let me click on it.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': '[Feature suggestion] WCAG trash panda mode link'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the URL has changed to `/byteblaze/a11y-webring.club/-/issues/39`, which suggests the issue page is loading. I can also see at the bottom of the page text showing "6 checklist items completed". Let me wait for the page to fully load.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! The issue page has loaded. I can see:

**Title:** [Feature suggestion] WCAG trash panda mode

**Status:** At the top, I can see a green badge that says "Open" next to "Issue created 2 years ago by Byte Blaze"

This shows the issue is **OPEN**, not closed.

On the right side, I can also see:
- Labels: "feature" and "help wanted"
- The issue is currently open

Since the task asks me to check if the latest created issue with "feature" in its title is closed, and I can clearly see this issue is **OPEN** (indicated by the green "Open" badge), I have my answer.

However, let me verify this is indeed the latest one. Looking at the status badge at the top:
- "Open" badge (green)
- "Issue created 2 years ago"

The issue is **OPEN**, not closed.
[tool] mcp__task-completion__complete_task: {'finalAnswer': 'No, the latest created issue with "feature" in its title ("[Feature suggestion] WCAG trash panda mode") is not closed. It is currently Open.'}

Now let me try to navigate directly to the issues page. I\'ll click on the URL bar and type the issues URL. In GitLab, the issues dashboard is typically at `/dashboard/issues`. Let me click on the address bar.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'target\': \'Address bar showing ec2-3-149-78-74.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:8023\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect!

The Issues page has loaded. I can see:\n- A heading "Issues" at the top\n- Three tabs: "Open", "Closed", "All" (currently on "Open" tab)\n- A search/filter box that says "Search or filter results..."\n- A message saying "Please select at least one filter to see results"\n- A "Created date" dropdown on the right\n\nI need to find issues I created that have "feature" in the title. Let me use the search box to search for "feature" and also ensure I\'m filtering to show issues I created. Let me click on the search box first.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'target\': \'Search or filter results input field\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect! A dropdown menu appeared with filter options:\n- Author\n- Assignee\n- Milestone\n- Release\n- Label\n- My-Reaction\n\nI need to filter by "Author" to see issues I created. Let me click on "Author".\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'target\': \'Author option in the dropdown menu\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood! The Author filter has been added to the search box. Now I see a dropdown with options:\n- = (equals)\n- is\n- != (not equals)\n- is not\n\nI need to select "=" or "is" to specify that I\'m the author. Let me click on "=" to set myself as the author.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'target\': \'= option in the dropdown\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect! A list of users appeared. I can see:\n- Byte Blaze (@byteblaze) - at the top\n- And several other users below\n\nSince I\'m logged in as "Byte Blaze" (as I saw earlier in the profile menu), I should select "Byte Blaze" to filter for issues I created. Let me click on it.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'target\': \'Byte Blaze @byteblaze option at the top of the user list\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood! The filter now shows "Author = Byte Blaze" in the search box. However, I still see the message "Please select at least one filter to see results". It seems the filter hasn\'t been applied yet. Let me wait a moment for the page to load or I need to press Enter to apply the filter.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'keys\': [\'enter\']}\n[result] Keys pressed successfully\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'duration\': 2000}\n[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nExcellent! The filter has been applied and now I can see a list of issues I created. I can see at the top of the tabs:\n- Open: 19\n- Closed: 59\n- All: 78\n\nLooking at the visible issues, I can see several with "feature" in the title:\n1. **[Feature suggestion] WCAG trash panda mode** - created 2 years ago, labels: "feature", "help wanted", updated 2 years ago\n2. **[Feature suggestion] Add a submission form** - created 2 years ago, label: "feature", updated 2 years ago\n3. **[Feature suggestion] Color theme slider** - created 2 years ago, labels: "feature", "help wanted", updated 2 years ago\n\nThe task asks me to find my **latest created issue that has feature in its title**. I need to check the "Created date" sorting to make sure I\'m seeing them in the correct order. I can see the "Created date" dropdown on the right. Let me check if there are more recent issues by looking at the sort order. The top issue shows "created 2 years ago", but I need to verify this is sorted by creation date in descending order (newest first).\n\nLet me click on the "Created date" dropdown to see the sorting options.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'target\': \'Created date dropdown button on the right side of the page\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect! A dropdown menu appeared showing sorting options:\n- Priority\n- **Created date** ✓ (currently selected)\n- Closed date\n- Updated date\n- Milestone due date\n- Due date\n- Popularity\n- Label priority\n- Manual\n- Title\n\nGood! It\'s already sorted by "Created date". Now I need to check if it\'s sorting in descending order (newest first) or ascending order (oldest first). Looking at the issues, I see:\n- First issue: created 2 years ago\n- Second issue: created 2 years ago\n- Fourth issue: created 3 years ago\n- Fifth issue: created 3 years ago\n\nThis suggests it might be sorted with newest first. However, I need to click on the sort direction icon (the arrow) to ensure I\'m seeing the newest issues first. Let me close this dropdown first and check the sort arrow.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'keys\': [\'escape\']}\n[result] Keys pressed successfully\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\'}\n[result] {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood! Now I can see the list clearly. Looking at the issues with "feature" in the title, I see:\n1. **[Feature suggestion] WCAG trash panda mode** - created 2 years ago\n2. **[Feature suggestion] Add a submission form** - created 2 years ago  \n3. **[Feature suggestion] Color theme slider** - created 2 years ago\n\nI also notice there\'s an icon next to the "Created date" dropdown - it appears to be showing the sort direction. I can see there\'s a sort direction toggle button (two arrows icon) next to "Created date". The current sorting shows 2 years ago at the top, then 3 years, then 4 years, which means it\'s sorted newest first (descending order).\n\nBased on what I can see, the three "Feature suggestion" issues at the top were all created "2 years ago". Since they all have the same creation time display, I need to click on the first one to check if it\'s closed. The task says "latest created issue that has feature in its title", so I should click on the **first** one: "[Feature suggestion] WCAG trash panda mode".\n\nLet me click on it.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'target\': \'[Feature suggestion] WCAG trash panda mode link\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI can see the URL has changed to `/byteblaze/a11y-webring.club/-/issues/39`, which suggests the issue page is loading. I can also see at the bottom of the page text showing "6 checklist items completed". Let me wait for the page to fully load.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'duration\': 2000}\n[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect! The issue page has loaded. I can see:\n\n**Title:** [Feature suggestion] WCAG trash panda mode\n\n**Status:** At the top, I can see a green badge that says "Open" next to "Issue created 2 years ago by Byte Blaze"\n\nThis shows the issue is **OPEN**, not closed.\n\nOn the right side, I can also see:\n- Labels: "feature" and "help wanted"\n- The issue is currently open\n\nSince the task asks me to check if the latest created issue with "feature" in its title is closed, and I can clearly see this issue is **OPEN** (indicated by the green "Open" badge), I have my answer.\n\nHowever, let me verify this is indeed the latest one. Looking at the status badge at the top:\n- "Open" badge (green)\n- "Issue created 2 years ago"\n\nThe issue is **OPEN**, not closed.\n[tool] mcp__task-completion__complete_task: {\'finalAnswer\': \'No, the latest created issue with "feature" in its title ("[Feature suggestion] WCAG trash panda mode") is not closed.

It is currently Open.\nTask completed! I found your latest created issue with "feature" in its title, which is "[Feature suggestion] WCAG trash panda mode", and confirmed that it is **currently Open** (not closed), as indicated by the green "Open" status badge on the issue page.'}</pre></div><div class='parsed_action' style='background-color:yellow'><pre>stop [No, the latest created issue with \"feature\" in its title (\"[Feature suggestion] WCAG trash panda mode\") is not closed.
