Good! I'm now on the Ana Running Short product edit page. I can see product details, but I need to find the reviews section. In Magento admin, product reviews are typically in a separate section. Let me scroll down to see if there are tabs or sections for reviews.

- Review text: "Wore these for a year and they started falling apart. For the price I guess I'll just get another pair cuz I do like them. But I think a shoe should last longer. It's not like I can take my sneakers to a cobbler haha"

This appears to be showing only one review. Let me scroll up to see if there's more content in the Product Reviews section that I might have missed, or if there are navigation controls to see more reviews.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'short'}

Excellent! Now I can see more reviews. The Product Reviews section shows "3 records found" and I can see:

1. **Review ID 307** by Angeline:
   - Title: "it was really hard to find the right siz"
   - Review: "It was really hard to find the right size for these. I had to send them back 3 times before I got a pair that fit. Really aggravating!!! I ended up having to get two sizes larger than I usually wear and a wide, which I've never worn before in my life. Sizing is messed up do yourself a favor, go to the store and try them on."

2. **Review ID 308** by Marita:
   - Title: "VERY LIGHTWEIGHT COMFY-GOOD SHOES"
   - Review: "VERY LIGHTWEIGHT COMFY-GOOD SHOES"

3. **Review ID 309** by Pura (partially visible):

Perfect! I can now see all the information. From the reviews section, I found 3 customer reviews for the Ana Running Short. Let me compile the reasons why customers like this product based on the reviews I've seen:

From the 3 reviews:

1. **Review by Marita**: "VERY LIGHTWEIGHT COMFY-GOOD SHOES" - This is clearly positive, highlighting that customers like the product because it's:
   - Very lightweight
   - Comfortable
   - Good quality

2. **Review by Pura**: "Wore these for a year and they started falling apart. For the price I guess I'll just get another pair cuz I do like them. But I think a shoe should last longer. It's not like I can take my sneakers to a cobbler haha" - Despite some durability concerns, the customer mentions they "do like them" and would buy again, suggesting:
   - Good value for the price
   - They like the product enough to repurchase despite durability issues

3. **Review by Angeline**: Focused on sizing issues - this is not positive about liking the product, but rather complaining about sizing problems.

Based on these reviews, the main reasons customers like the Ana Running Short are:
1. Very lightweight
2. Comfortable
3. Good value for the price
