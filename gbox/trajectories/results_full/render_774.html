Good! I can see I'm on the Magento Admin Dashboard. I need to find where to manage reviews. In Magento admin panels, reviews are typically under Marketing or Content sections. Let me look at the left sidebar navigation menu to find the reviews section.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'MARKETING menu item in the left sidebar navigation'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I can see the Marketing menu has expanded and I can see under "User Content" section there are two review-related options:
- All Reviews
- Pending Reviews

Since I need to delete pending reviews with less than 4 stars, let me click on "Pending Reviews".
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'Pending Reviews link under User Content section in Marketing menu'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the URL has changed to the pending reviews page, but the page content hasn't loaded yet (still showing the dashboard behind the menu). Let me close this menu and wait for the page to load properly.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'X close button on the Marketing menu panel'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! Now I can see the Pending Reviews page has loaded. I can see the page shows "We couldn't find any records." This means there are currently no pending reviews visible. However, the menu is still open. Let me close it to see the full page better, and then I should check if there might be filters or if I need to look at "All Reviews" instead to find reviews that need to be deleted.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'keys': ['escape']}
[result] Keys pressed successfully
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c'}
[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The menu is still open. Let me click on the X button to close it.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'X close button in the top right of the Marketing menu panel'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I can see the Pending Reviews page clearly. It shows "0 records found" and "We couldn't find any records." This means there are currently no pending reviews in the system.

However, let me check the "All Reviews" section to see if there are any reviews at all that might have a "pending" status but are shown in the all reviews list. Let me navigate to All Reviews.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'MARKETING menu item in the left sidebar'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good, the Marketing menu is open again. Now let me click on "All Reviews" to see if there are any reviews there.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'All Reviews link under User Content section in Marketing menu'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I see the page is loading. Let me wait for it to fully load and then close the menu to see the content.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! Now I can see the "All Reviews" page has loaded with 348 records found. I can see there are multiple reviews showing, and all the visible ones have a status of "Approved". However, I need to find pending reviews with less than 4 stars. 

I notice there's a "Status" column with a dropdown filter. Let me filter by "Pending" status to see only pending reviews. But first, let me scroll right to see if there's a rating/stars column.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'short'}
[result] Scrolled down by short distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see more reviews, all with "Approved" status. I notice the columns shown are: ID, Created, Status, Title, Nickname, Review, Visibility, Type, Product, SKU, and Action. I don't see a star rating column visible in the current view. Let me scroll back up to use the Status filter to find pending reviews first.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'short'}
[result] Scrolled up by short distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good, I can see the filter row now. I can see the Status column has a dropdown filter. Let me click on the Status dropdown to filter for "Pending" reviews.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'Status dropdown filter in the filter row below the Status column header'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! The Status dropdown has opened and I can see three options:
- Approved
- Pending
- Not Approved

Let me select "Pending" to filter for pending reviews.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'Pending option in the Status dropdown menu'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I can see "Pending" has been selected in the Status filter dropdown. Now I need to click the "Search" button to apply this filter and see only pending reviews.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'target': 'Search button above the Actions dropdown'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the page is loading (there's a loading indicator at the top). Let me wait for the results to load after applying the "Pending" filter.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'b1a4bb98-6f00-4f1d-9751-82cd787cbe8c', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! The filter has been applied and the results show "0 records found" with the message "We couldn't find any records." This confirms that there are no pending reviews in the system at all.

Since there are no pending reviews, there are no pending reviews with less than 4 stars to delete. The task has been completed - there were simply no records matching the criteria.

Let me complete the task with the appropriate response.
[tool] mcp__task-completion__complete_task: {'finalAnswer': 'Task completed. There are no pending reviews in the system, therefore no pending reviews with less than 4 stars to delete.'}
[complete] Task completed. There are no pending reviews in the system, therefore no pending reviews with less than 4 stars to delete.
The task has been completed successfully. I searched through the Magento Admin panel's review management system and found that there are no pending reviews in the system at all. Since there are no pending reviews, there are no pending reviews with less than 4 stars that need to be deleted.</pre></div><div class='action_object' style='background-color:grey'><pre>{'action_type': <ActionTypes.STOP: 17>, 'coords': array([0., 0.], dtype=float32), 'element_role': 0, 'element_name': '', 'text': [], 'page_number': 0, 'url': '', 'nth': 0, 'pw_code': '', 'element_id': '', 'key_comb': '', 'direction': '', 'answer': 'Task completed.
