Good! I'm on the My Account page and I can see the "Recent Orders" section. I can see two orders:
- Order #000000170 from 5/17/23 - Status: Canceled - $365.42
- Order #000000189 from 5/2/23 - Status: Pending - $754.99

However, I need to see ALL orders from the past month (from 5/12/23 to 6/12/23, since today is 6/12/2023), not just recent orders. Let me click on "My Orders" in the left sidebar to see the full order list.

I see the page is loading to /sales/order/history/. Let me wait for it to load completely.

Excellent! I can see the "My Orders" page with a list of orders. I can see there are 37 total orders (showing items 1 to 10 of 37 total). 

Now I need to identify which orders are:
1. From the past month (5/12/23 to 6/12/23, since today is 6/12/2023)
2. Have a status of "Complete" (fulfilled orders)

Looking at the current page, I can see orders from various dates. Let me analyze what's visible:

Orders in the past month (5/12/23 to 6/12/23):
- 000000170 - 5/17/23 - $365.42 - Canceled (NOT fulfilled)
- 000000189 - 5/2/23 - $754.99 - Pending (NOT in date range - 5/2 is before 5/12)
- 000000188 - 5/2/23 - $2,004.99 - Pending (NOT in date range)
- 000000187 - 5/2/23 - $1,004.99 - Pending (NOT in date range)

Wait, let me recalculate. If today is 6/12/2023, then "past month" means from 5/12/23 to 6/12/23. Let me look more carefully at the orders.

From the visible orders:
- 5/17/23 - within the past month
- 5/2/23 - NOT within the past month (before 5/12)
- 3/11/23, 3/10/23, 2/27/23, 2/24/23, 2/11/23, 2/9/23 - all NOT within the past month

I need to see more orders. There might be orders from late May and June. Let me check if there are more pages or if I need to scroll. I can see pagination at the bottom showing pages 1, 2, 3, 4. Let me click on page 2 to see more orders.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'pagination link for page 2'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
It looks like the page is still showing the same content. Let me wait for it to load and take another screenshot.

Good! Now I'm on page 2 (showing items 11 to 20 of 37 total). I can see orders from 2022 and early 2023. None of these orders are within the past month (5/12/23 to 6/12/23). 

Let me go back to page 1 to see if there are more recent orders, or check the other pages. Since the orders seem to be sorted in reverse chronological order (newest first), I should check page 1 again and possibly look for orders between 5/12/23 and 6/12/23.

Let me click on page 1 to go back.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'pagination link for page 1'}

[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I'm back on page 1. Now let me analyze the orders carefully. I need to find orders from the past month (5/12/23 to 6/12/23) that have "Complete" status.

Looking at page 1, I can see:
- 000000170 - 5/17/23 - $365.42 - Canceled (within date range but NOT fulfilled)
- 000000189 - 5/2/23 - Pending (NOT in date range - before 5/12)
- 000000188 - 5/2/23 - Pending (NOT in date range)
- 000000187 - 5/2/23 - Pending (NOT in date range)
- 000000180 - 3/11/23 - Complete (NOT in date range)
- 000000166 - 3/10/23 - Complete (NOT in date range)
- 000000161 - 2/27/23 - Complete (NOT in date range)
- 000000156 - 2/24/23 - Canceled (NOT in date range)
- 000000158 - 2/11/23 - Canceled (NOT in date range)
- 000000157 - 2/9/23 - Complete (NOT in date range)

I can see only ONE order on page 1 that's within the date range (5/17/23), but it's "Canceled" not "Complete". 

The task asks for orders over the past month (from 5/12/23 to 6/12/23). Let me check if there might be more orders from May or June that I haven't seen yet. Since there are 37 total orders and orders seem to be sorted by date (newest first), there might be more recent orders. But wait - if order 000000170 from 5/17/23 is at the top, there shouldn't be any orders after that date unless they have higher order numbers.

Let me scroll up on this page to see if there are any orders above the visible area, or check if there's any filtering option to show only "Complete" orders.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled up by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I see the same view. Looking at this carefully, I notice that the most recent order is from 5/17/23. However, I need to check all the orders more carefully. Let me think about the date range again:

Today is 6/12/2023, so "past month" means from 5/12/23 to 6/12/23.

Looking at the visible orders on page 1:
- 5/17/23 - within range but Canceled
- 5/2/23 (multiple) - before 5/12, NOT in range
- 3/11/23 and earlier - NOT in range

It seems like there might not be many orders in the past month, or perhaps the dates shown are in a different format. Let me look more carefully at the orders. I notice there are orders from 5/2/23, which is close to the date range. But wait - could there be orders from late May or June that I haven't seen?

Let me change the display to show more items per page to get a better view of all orders. I see a dropdown that says "10 per page". Let me try to change it to show more items.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'dropdown menu showing "10" per page at the bottom right'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Great! A dropdown menu appeared with options: 10, 20, and 50. Let me select "50" to see all 37 orders on one page.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': '50 option in the dropdown menu'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I can see the dropdown now shows "50" per page. Let me wait for the page to reload with all orders visible.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'duration': 2000}
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86'}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I can see more orders on the page. Let me scroll down to see all the orders and identify which ones are from the past month (5/12/23 to 6/12/23) with "Complete" status.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I can see the end of the list showing "37 item(s)" at the bottom. Now I can see all the orders are from 2022. Let me scroll back up to see all the orders from the beginning and carefully identify which ones fall within the past month (5/12/23 to 6/12/23) with "Complete" status.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'long'}
[result] Scrolled up by long distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I can see all the orders. Let me analyze them carefully to find orders from the past month (5/12/23 to 6/12/23) with "Complete" status.

Looking at the visible orders:
- 000000170 - 5/17/23 - $365.42 - Canceled (NOT fulfilled)
- 000000189 - 5/2/23 - Pending (NOT in range - before 5/12)
- 000000188 - 5/2/23 - Pending (NOT in range)
- 000000187 - 5/2/23 - Pending (NOT in range)
- 000000180 - 3/11/23 - Complete (NOT in range)
- 000000166 - 3/10/23 - Complete (NOT in range)
- 000000161 - 2/27/23 - Complete (NOT in range)
- And all others are from 2022...

Wait, I notice that the dates appear to be in M/D/YY format. Looking more carefully:
- 5/17/23 means May 17, 2023
- 5/2/23 means May 2, 2023

So the date range I need is 5/12/23 to 6/12/23. That means:
- From May 12, 2023 to June 12, 2023

Looking at the orders again:
- 5/17/23 is within the range (May 17, 2023) but it's "Canceled", not "Complete"
- 5/2/23 orders are before May 12, so they're NOT in range

I don't see any orders from late May or June 2023 in the list. The most recent order is from 5/17/23. This means there's only ONE order within the past month (5/17/23), but it's "Canceled", NOT "Complete".

Therefore, there are **0 fulfilled orders** in the past month, which means the total amount spent on fulfilled orders is **$0.00**.

Let me verify this by scrolling down slightly to make sure I see all orders around that time period.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'short'}
[result] Scrolled down by short distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the bottom of the list now showing "37 item(s)". Let me scroll back up to see the complete list from the top to do a thorough analysis.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'long'}
[result] Scrolled up by long distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I can see all the orders clearly. Let me carefully analyze which orders fall within the past month (5/12/23 to 6/12/23) and have "Complete" status:

Looking at the dates from top to bottom:
- 000000170 - 5/17/23 - $365.42 - **Canceled** (within range but NOT Complete)
- 000000189 - 5/2/23 - Pending (NOT in range - before 5/12)
- 000000188 - 5/2/23 - Pending (NOT in range)
- 000000187 - 5/2/23 - Pending (NOT in range)
- 000000180 - 3/11/23 - Complete (NOT in range)
- 000000166 - 3/10/23 - Complete (NOT in range)
- 000000161 - 2/27/23 - Complete (NOT in range)
- All remaining orders are from 2023 (January, February) or 2022

Wait, let me reconsider. I see 5/17/23 which is May 17, 2023. That IS within the range of 5/12/23 to 6/12/23, but it's "Canceled", not "Complete".

Looking more carefully at all the dates, I can see:
- The most recent order is 5/17/23 (Canceled)
- Then 5/2/23 orders (Pending, but also before 5/12/23)
- Then orders from March 2023 and earlier

I don't see ANY orders from late May or June 2023. This means:
- **0 fulfilled (Complete) orders** in the past month (5/12/23 to 6/12/23)
- **Total amount spent: $0.00**

But wait, let me scroll down one more time to make absolutely sure I'm seeing all the data correctly and there are no orders between 5/17/23 and the earlier dates that I might have missed.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'tiny'}
[result] Scrolled down by tiny distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good, I can see more of the middle section. I can see orders going from early 2023 down through 2022. Let me scroll back to the top to make a complete analysis.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled up by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I can see the complete picture. Let me analyze all orders systematically:

**Orders within the date range 5/12/23 to 6/12/23:**

Looking at all 37 orders, the only order within the past month (5/12/23 to 6/12/23) is:
- Order #000000170 - 5/17/23 - $365.42 - Status: **Canceled** (NOT Complete/Fulfilled)

All other orders are either:
- Before 5/12/23 (like the 5/2/23 orders)
- From 2022 or early 2023 (March and earlier)

**Conclusion:**
- **Number of fulfilled (Complete) orders in the past month: 0**
- **Total amount spent on fulfilled orders: $0.00**
[tool] mcp__task-completion__complete_task: {'finalAnswer': '0 fulfilled orders, $0.00 total spent'}
[complete] 0 fulfilled orders, $0.00 total spent
The task is complete! I've analyzed all 37 orders in the account and found that over the past month (from 5/12/23 to 6/12/23, with today being 6/12/2023), there were **0 fulfilled orders** and **$0.00 total spent**. 

The only order within that date range was Order #000000170 from 5/17/23 for $365.42, but it had a status of "Canceled" rather than "Complete", so it doesn't count as a fulfilled order.</pre></div><div class='action_object' style='background-color:grey'><pre>{'action_type': <ActionTypes.STOP: 17>, 'coords': array([0., 0.], dtype=float32), 'element_role': 0, 'element_name': '', 'text': [], 'page_number': 0, 'url': '', 'nth': 0, 'pw_code': '', 'element_id': '', 'key_comb': '', 'direction': '', 'answer': '0 fulfilled orders, $0.00 total spent', 'raw_prediction': 'I\'ll help you find the number of fulfilled orders and total amount spent over the past month.

I can see the "My Orders" page with a list of orders. I can see there are 37 total orders (showing items 1 to 10 of 37 total). \n\nNow I need to identify which orders are:\n1. From the past month (5/12/23 to 6/12/23, since today is 6/12/2023)\n2. Have a status of "Complete" (fulfilled orders)\n\nLooking at the current page, I can see orders from various dates. Let me analyze what\'s visible:\n\nOrders in the past month (5/12/23 to 6/12/23):\n- 000000170 - 5/17/23 - $365.42 - Canceled (NOT fulfilled)\n- 000000189 - 5/2/23 - $754.99 - Pending (NOT in date range - 5/2 is before 5/12)\n- 000000188 - 5/2/23 - $2,004.99 - Pending (NOT in date range)\n- 000000187 - 5/2/23 - $1,004.99 - Pending (NOT in date range)\n\nWait, let me recalculate. If today is 6/12/2023, then "past month" means from 5/12/23 to 6/12/23. Let me look more carefully at the orders.\n\nFrom the visible orders:\n- 5/17/23 - within the past month\n- 5/2/23 - NOT within the past month (before 5/12)\n- 3/11/23, 3/10/23, 2/27/23, 2/24/23, 2/11/23, 2/9/23 - all NOT within the past month\n\nI need to see more orders. There might be orders from late May and June. Let me check if there are more pages or if I need to scroll. I can see pagination at the bottom showing pages 1, 2, 3, 4. Let me click on page 2 to see more orders.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'target\': \'pagination link for page 2\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nIt looks like the page is still showing the same content.

Now I\'m on page 2 (showing items 11 to 20 of 37 total). I can see orders from 2022 and early 2023. None of these orders are within the past month (5/12/23 to 6/12/23). \n\nLet me go back to page 1 to see if there are more recent orders, or check the other pages. Since the orders seem to be sorted in reverse chronological order (newest first), I should check page 1 again and possibly look for orders between 5/12/23 and 6/12/23.\n\nLet me click on page 1 to go back.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'target\': \'pagination link for page 1\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI see the URL is still showing ?p=2 but it\'s loading.

I\'m back on page 1. Now let me analyze the orders carefully. I need to find orders from the past month (5/12/23 to 6/12/23) that have "Complete" status.\n\nLooking at page 1, I can see:\n- 000000170 - 5/17/23 - $365.42 - Canceled (within date range but NOT fulfilled)\n- 000000189 - 5/2/23 - Pending (NOT in date range - before 5/12)\n- 000000188 - 5/2/23 - Pending (NOT in date range)\n- 000000187 - 5/2/23 - Pending (NOT in date range)\n- 000000180 - 3/11/23 - Complete (NOT in date range)\n- 000000166 - 3/10/23 - Complete (NOT in date range)\n- 000000161 - 2/27/23 - Complete (NOT in date range)\n- 000000156 - 2/24/23 - Canceled (NOT in date range)\n- 000000158 - 2/11/23 - Canceled (NOT in date range)\n- 000000157 - 2/9/23 - Complete (NOT in date range)\n\nI can see only ONE order on page 1 that\'s within the date range (5/17/23), but it\'s "Canceled" not "Complete". \n\nThe task asks for orders over the past month (from 5/12/23 to 6/12/23). Let me check if there might be more orders from May or June that I haven\'t seen yet. Since there are 37 total orders and orders seem to be sorted by date (newest first), there might be more recent orders. But wait - if order 000000170 from 5/17/23 is at the top, there shouldn\'t be any orders after that date unless they have higher order numbers.\n\nLet me scroll up on this page to see if there are any orders above the visible area, or check if there\'s any filtering option to show only "Complete" orders.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'direction\': \'up\', \'distance\': \'medium\'}\n[result] Scrolled up by medium distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI see the same view. Looking at this carefully, I notice that the most recent order is from 5/17/23. However, I need to check all the orders more carefully. Let me think about the date range again:\n\nToday is 6/12/2023, so "past month" means from 5/12/23 to 6/12/23.\n\nLooking at the visible orders on page 1:\n- 5/17/23 - within range but Canceled\n- 5/2/23 (multiple) - before 5/12, NOT in range\n- 3/11/23 and earlier - NOT in range\n\nIt seems like there might not be many orders in the past month, or perhaps the dates shown are in a different format. Let me look more carefully at the orders. I notice there are orders from 5/2/23, which is close to the date range. But wait - could there be orders from late May or June that I haven\'t seen?\n\nLet me change the display to show more items per page to get a better view of all orders. I see a dropdown that says "10 per page". Let me try to change it to show more items.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'target\': \'dropdown menu showing "10" per page at the bottom right\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGreat!

Let me wait for the page to reload with all orders visible.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'duration\': 2000}\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\'}\n[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\n[result] {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect! Now I can see more orders on the page. Let me scroll down to see all the orders and identify which ones are from the past month (5/12/23 to 6/12/23) with "Complete" status.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'direction\': \'down\', \'distance\': \'medium\'}\n[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood! I can see the end of the list showing "37 item(s)" at the bottom. Now I can see all the orders are from 2022. Let me scroll back up to see all the orders from the beginning and carefully identify which ones fall within the past month (5/12/23 to 6/12/23) with "Complete" status.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'direction\': \'up\', \'distance\': \'long\'}\n[result] Scrolled up by long distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect! Now I can see all the orders. Let me analyze them carefully to find orders from the past month (5/12/23 to 6/12/23) with "Complete" status.\n\nLooking at the visible orders:\n- 000000170 - 5/17/23 - $365.42 - Canceled (NOT fulfilled)\n- 000000189 - 5/2/23 - Pending (NOT in range - before 5/12)\n- 000000188 - 5/2/23 - Pending (NOT in range)\n- 000000187 - 5/2/23 - Pending (NOT in range)\n- 000000180 - 3/11/23 - Complete (NOT in range)\n- 000000166 - 3/10/23 - Complete (NOT in range)\n- 000000161 - 2/27/23 - Complete (NOT in range)\n- And all others are from 2022...\n\nWait, I notice that the dates appear to be in M/D/YY format. Looking more carefully:\n- 5/17/23 means May 17, 2023\n- 5/2/23 means May 2, 2023\n\nSo the date range I need is 5/12/23 to 6/12/23. That means:\n- From May 12, 2023 to June 12, 2023\n\nLooking at the orders again:\n- 5/17/23 is within the range (May 17, 2023) but it\'s "Canceled", not "Complete"\n- 5/2/23 orders are before May 12, so they\'re NOT in range\n\nI don\'t see any orders from late May or June 2023 in the list. The most recent order is from 5/17/23. This means there\'s only ONE order within the past month (5/17/23), but it\'s "Canceled", NOT "Complete".\n\nTherefore, there are **0 fulfilled orders** in the past month, which means the total amount spent on fulfilled orders is **$0.00**.\n\nLet me verify this by scrolling down slightly to make sure I see all orders around that time period.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'direction\': \'down\', \'distance\': \'short\'}\n[result] Scrolled down by short distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI can see the bottom of the list now showing "37 item(s)".

Now I can see all the orders clearly. Let me carefully analyze which orders fall within the past month (5/12/23 to 6/12/23) and have "Complete" status:\n\nLooking at the dates from top to bottom:\n- 000000170 - 5/17/23 - $365.42 - **Canceled** (within range but NOT Complete)\n- 000000189 - 5/2/23 - Pending (NOT in range - before 5/12)\n- 000000188 - 5/2/23 - Pending (NOT in range)\n- 000000187 - 5/2/23 - Pending (NOT in range)\n- 000000180 - 3/11/23 - Complete (NOT in range)\n- 000000166 - 3/10/23 - Complete (NOT in range)\n- 000000161 - 2/27/23 - Complete (NOT in range)\n- All remaining orders are from 2023 (January, February) or 2022\n\nWait, let me reconsider. I see 5/17/23 which is May 17, 2023. That IS within the range of 5/12/23 to 6/12/23, but it\'s "Canceled", not "Complete".\n\nLooking more carefully at all the dates, I can see:\n- The most recent order is 5/17/23 (Canceled)\n- Then 5/2/23 orders (Pending, but also before 5/12/23)\n- Then orders from March 2023 and earlier\n\nI don\'t see ANY orders from late May or June 2023. This means:\n- **0 fulfilled (Complete) orders** in the past month (5/12/23 to 6/12/23)\n- **Total amount spent: $0.00**\n\nBut wait, let me scroll down one more time to make absolutely sure I\'m seeing all the data correctly and there are no orders between 5/17/23 and the earlier dates that I might have missed.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'d789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86\', \'direction\': \'down\', \'distance\': \'tiny\'}\n[result] Scrolled down by tiny distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood, I can see more of the middle section.
