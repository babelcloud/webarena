Excellent! The search found CMU ArtPark Lab and the map has zoomed into the location. I can see:

- The search result shows: "Park CMU ArtPark Lab, North Oakland, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, United States"
- The map is now showing the area around CMU ArtPark Lab with various restaurants and establishments marked with icons

I can already see several restaurant icons on the map in the surrounding area. I can see icons for:
- Luca's Ristorante (Italian restaurant icon)
- Koi (appears to be a restaurant)
- Patron Mexican Grill
- Union Grill
- Various other food establishments marked with knife and fork icons

Let me click on the search result to get more details about the exact location, then I'll systematically identify all the restaurants around it.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Park CMU ArtPark Lab, North Oakland, Pittsburgh, Allegheny County, United States link in the search results'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I can see the CMU ArtPark Lab is highlighted on the map (shown as an orange area). The left panel shows details about it. Now I need to identify all the restaurants around this location. I can already see several restaurant icons on the map. Let me systematically click on each restaurant marker to get their names. 

Let me start with the restaurants I can see nearby. I'll click on the restaurant icons one by one to identify them. Let me start with "Luca's Ristorante" which is visible at the top left.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': "Luca's Ristorante restaurant icon with fork and knife symbol in the upper left area of the map near Filmore Street"}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The click didn't change the left panel. Let me try clicking directly on one of the visible restaurant labels on the map. I can see "Luca's Ristorante" text on the map. Let me click on that text.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': "Luca's Ristorante text label on the map in the upper left area"}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the restaurants are labeled on the map directly. Let me take a closer look and compile a list of all visible restaurants. From what I can see on the current view, I can identify several restaurants around CMU ArtPark Lab. Let me scroll around the map a bit to make sure I capture all nearby restaurants, or I can read what's currently visible.

From the current screenshot, I can see these restaurants labeled on the map near CMU ArtPark Lab:
- Luca's Ristorante (upper left)
- Koi's (center area)
- Patron (center area)
- Union Grill (center area)

Let me zoom out slightly to see if there are more restaurants in the vicinity, and also try to click on the map in different areas to see more details.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'minus zoom out button on the right side of the map'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I zoomed out a bit and can now see a wider area around CMU ArtPark Lab (shown in orange). I can see several restaurant icons (fork and knife symbols) around the area. Let me zoom back in to the original level to see the restaurant names more clearly, and then systematically identify each one.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'plus zoom in button on the right side of the map'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I'm back at a good zoom level where I can see the restaurant labels clearly. Looking at the map around CMU ArtPark Lab (the orange highlighted area), I can identify several restaurants. Let me carefully read all the visible restaurant names on the map:

In the immediate vicinity of CMU ArtPark Lab, I can see:
1. **Luca's Ristorante** - in the upper left area near Filmore Street
2. **Koi's** - in the central area (pink building area)
3. **Patron** - shown with a fork/knife icon in the central area
4. **Union Grill** - in the central area
5. **Subway** - visible in the left area

I can also see other food-related icons. Let me scroll the map slightly to check if there are more restaurants I might have missed in the surrounding area. Let me pan the map a bit to see all sides of the CMU ArtPark Lab.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'short'}
[result] Scrolled up by short distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The view hasn't changed much. Let me try a different approach. Let me close the left panel to get a better view of the map, or let me try clicking on individual restaurant icons to get their full names. Let me click on the "Koi's" area to see if I can get more information.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': "Koi's text label in the pink building area in the center of the map"}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The left panel is still showing the CMU ArtPark Lab information. Let me close this panel first by clicking the X, so I can get a clearer view of all the restaurants on the map, and then I'll compile the complete list.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'X close button next to Way: CMU ArtPark Lab heading in the left panel'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! Now I have a much clearer view of the map showing the area around CMU ArtPark Lab (which is labeled in the center-right area as "CMU ArtPark Lab"). I can now see the restaurant names more clearly. Let me identify all the restaurants visible around this location:

Looking at the map, I can see the following restaurants around CMU ArtPark Lab:

1. **Luca's Ristorante** - upper left area
2. **Lulu's Noodles** - left side
3. **Kashi's** - center area (appears to show "Kashi's" not "Koi's")
4. **Patron** - center area
5. **Piada** - center area (appears to be "Indian Piada")
6. **Union Grill** - center right area
7. **Orient Express** - right side
8. **Oishii Bento** - visible in the area
9. **Subway** - left area

Let me try to click on a few more locations to ensure I'm capturing all restaurant names correctly. Let me click on one of the restaurant icons to verify the names.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'Patron text label with fork and knife icon in the center area of the map'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The click didn't open a detail panel. Let me take a more careful look at the current map and read all the text labels visible. I can see several restaurant names clearly labeled. Let me create a comprehensive list by carefully reading what's on the map, and then I'll pan around to see if there are more restaurants in other directions.

From the current view, I can clearly see these restaurants around CMU ArtPark Lab:

**Upper left area (pink building):**

- Lulu's Noodles

[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'short'}
[result] Scrolled down by short distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I scrolled too far and the map zoomed way out. I can see the CMU area is now very small in the center. Let me zoom back in to the CMU ArtPark Lab area to continue identifying restaurants.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'the small map cluster visible in the center of the screen'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
This is now showing the entire Pittsburgh area. I need to zoom back into CMU ArtPark Lab. Let me search for it again to get back to the proper location.

[result] Text typed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good, the search is loading. Let me wait for it to complete.

[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I'm back at the CMU ArtPark Lab location with a good view of the surrounding area. Let me close the search results panel to get a clearer view of all the restaurant labels on the map.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c', 'target': 'X close button next to Search Results in the left panel'}

Let me zoom back in to the original level to see the restaurant names more clearly, and then systematically identify each one.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'target\': \'plus zoom in button on the right side of the map\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect! Now I\'m back at a good zoom level where I can see the restaurant labels clearly. Looking at the map around CMU ArtPark Lab (the orange highlighted area), I can identify several restaurants. Let me carefully read all the visible restaurant names on the map:\n\nIn the immediate vicinity of CMU ArtPark Lab, I can see:\n1. **Luca\'s Ristorante** - in the upper left area near Filmore Street\n2. **Koi\'s** - in the central area (pink building area)\n3. **Patron** - shown with a fork/knife icon in the central area\n4. **Union Grill** - in the central area\n5. **Subway** - visible in the left area\n\nI can also see other food-related icons. Let me scroll the map slightly to check if there are more restaurants I might have missed in the surrounding area. Let me pan the map a bit to see all sides of the CMU ArtPark Lab.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'direction\': \'up\', \'distance\': \'short\'}\n[result] Scrolled up by short distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nThe view hasn\'t changed much. Let me try a different approach. Let me close the left panel to get a better view of the map, or let me try clicking on individual restaurant icons to get their full names. Let me click on the "Koi\'s" area to see if I can get more information.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'target\': "Koi\'s text label in the pink building area in the center of the map"}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nThe left panel is still showing the CMU ArtPark Lab information. Let me close this panel first by clicking the X, so I can get a clearer view of all the restaurants on the map, and then I\'ll compile the complete list.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'target\': \'X close button next to Way: CMU ArtPark Lab heading in the left panel\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nExcellent! Now I have a much clearer view of the map showing the area around CMU ArtPark Lab (which is labeled in the center-right area as "CMU ArtPark Lab"). I can now see the restaurant names more clearly. Let me identify all the restaurants visible around this location:\n\nLooking at the map, I can see the following restaurants around CMU ArtPark Lab:\n\n1. **Luca\'s Ristorante** - upper left area\n2. **Lulu\'s Noodles** - left side\n3. **Kashi\'s** - center area (appears to show "Kashi\'s" not "Koi\'s")\n4. **Patron** - center area\n5. **Piada** - center area (appears to be "Indian Piada")\n6. **Union Grill** - center right area\n7. **Orient Express** - right side\n8. **Oishii Bento** - visible in the area\n9. **Subway** - left area\n\nLet me try to click on a few more locations to ensure I\'m capturing all restaurant names correctly.

Let me take a more careful look at the current map and read all the text labels visible. I can see several restaurant names clearly labeled. Let me create a comprehensive list by carefully reading what\'s on the map, and then I\'ll pan around to see if there are more restaurants in other directions.\n\nFrom the current view, I can clearly see these restaurants around CMU ArtPark Lab:\n\n**Upper left area (pink building):**\n- Luca\'s Ristorante\n- Lulu\'s Noodles\n- Kashi\'s\n\n**Center/left area:**\n- Indian Eatery\n- Piada\n- Patron\n- Union Grill\n- Subway\n\n**Center/right area:**\n- Orient Express\n- Oishii Bento\n\nLet me pan the map to the right to see if there are more restaurants on that side of CMU ArtPark Lab.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'direction\': \'down\', \'distance\': \'short\'}\n[result] Scrolled down by short distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI scrolled too far and the map zoomed way out. I can see the CMU area is now very small in the center. Let me zoom back in to the CMU ArtPark Lab area to continue identifying restaurants.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'60165e37-5c18-41fb-aa49-ebe3a69b5f5c\', \'target\': \'the small map cluster visible in the center of the screen\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nThis is now showing the entire Pittsburgh area.
