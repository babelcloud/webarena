Good! I can see I'm on a Postmill forum website (which appears to be like Reddit). I can see there are two tabs open - one is the CDP URL page (New Tab) that I should never switch to, and the other is the Postmill forum I'm currently on.

Currently, I'm viewing what appears to be the "space" forum with various posts. My task is to:
1. Navigate to the "books" forum
2. Find a trending post
3. Open that thread
4. Subscribe to it

Let me click on "Forums" in the navigation to find the "books" forum.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'Forums link in the red navigation bar at the top'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I see the URL changed to /forums but the page content looks the same. Let me wait a moment for the page to load and then take another screenshot.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'duration': 1000}

[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I can see the "List of forums" page. I can see various forums like AskReddit, relationship_advice, worldnews, news, movies, memes, wallstreetbets, and gaming. I need to scroll down to find the "books" forum.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good, I scrolled down and can see more forums: technology, pics, funny, television, mildlyinteresting, Showerthoughts, todayilearned, personalfinance, LifeProTips, and Futurology. I still haven't found the "books" forum yet. Let me continue scrolling down.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}

Excellent! I found the "books" forum! I can see it in the list with 1,796 submissions. Now I need to click on it to navigate to the books forum.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'target': 'books forum link with text "/r/books" in red'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the URL has changed to /f/books, which indicates the page is loading. Let me wait a moment and then take a screenshot to see the books forum page.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': 'd789bbec-453c-4091-b1ed-37d64d591a86', 'duration': 1500}

Perfect! I'm now on the /f/books forum page. I can see several posts with their scores (upvotes). The posts are currently sorted by "Hot" which shows trending posts. Looking at the scores:

1. "Adults reading to each other out loud?" - 1 point
2. "Friendly reminder bookshop.org exists." - 3085 points (126 comments)
3. "The letters of T. S. Eliot to Emily Hale..." - 3591 points (184 comments)
4. "Appalachian prison book project..." - 1716 points (33 comments)
5. "After Two Decades And 38 Children's Books..." - 1695 points (27 comments)
6. "Museum issues appeal to save famed 'Misty of Chincoteague'..." - 1539 points (43 comments)
7. "How Ukrainian publishers are fighting to survive" - 1434 points (31 comments)
8. "The simple greatness of Agatha Christie" - 1423 points

The post with the highest score (most trending) is "The letters of T. S. Eliot to Emily Hale that were kept sealed from 1956 to 2020 have been released for free online" with 3591 points. This is the trending post I should open.

Let me click on this post to open the thread.

It seems the click didn't navigate to the post thread. The URL is still /f/books. Let me try clicking on the "184 comments" link instead, which should take me to the thread.
