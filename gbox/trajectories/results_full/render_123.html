[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I can see the Products page has loaded. There's currently a filter for "Olivia" products showing 16 records. I need to search for "Circe" instead. Let me clear this filter and search for Circe's products. I'll click on "Clear all" to remove the current filter.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'Clear all link in the top right of the filters section'}

Perfect! Now I can see 16 Circe products have been found. All of them appear to be "Circe Hooded Ice Fleece" products in various colors. However, to find out why customers like these products, I need to look at customer reviews. This admin interface shows product listings but not reviews. Let me check if there's a way to view reviews in the admin panel. Let me try accessing the MARKETING section to see if there's a reviews section, or I should check the actual customer-facing website to see reviews.

Actually, let me first check one of these products to see if there's a reviews section. Let me click on one of the Circe products.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'Circe Hooded Ice Fleece product name in the first row'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I see the page is loading. Let me wait a moment for it to fully load.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I'm now on the "Circe Hooded Ice Fleece" product page. I can see various product details fields. Let me scroll down to see if there's a reviews section or any customer feedback information on this page.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see more product attributes like Country of Manufacture, Activity, Style General, Material, and Sleeve. This is still product information but not customer reviews. Let me continue scrolling to see if there's a reviews section.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see more product attributes including Collar, Pattern, Climate, Color, Eco Collection, Performance Fabric, and Erin Recommends. Still no reviews section. Let me continue scrolling to see if reviews appear further down the page.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the Configurations section showing different variations of the Circe Hooded Ice Fleece product. Let me continue scrolling to see if there's a reviews section further down.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! I found the "Product Reviews" section! Let me click on it to expand and see the customer reviews.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'Product Reviews section heading'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the Product Reviews section has expanded, but it appears to be empty - there's no content shown in that section. This might mean there are no reviews for this product in the admin panel, or the reviews need to be accessed differently. Let me try checking the MARKETING section in the sidebar to see if there's a dedicated Reviews management area, or I should access the customer-facing website to see actual reviews.

Let me click on the MARKETING section in the left sidebar.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'MARKETING menu item in the left sidebar'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Excellent! I can see the Marketing menu has opened and there are two important options: "All Reviews" and "Pending Reviews". I can also see at the bottom of the page that "2 records found" which suggests there are reviews. Let me click on "All Reviews" to see all the reviews.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'All Reviews option in the Marketing menu'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see the page is loading and shows "2 records found" at the bottom. Let me close the Marketing menu first and then wait for the page to fully load the reviews.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'X close button in the Marketing menu'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
I can see that I'm back on the product page and there's a "Product Reviews" section showing "2 records found" at the bottom. I can see a table with columns for ID, Created, Status, Title, Nickname, Review, Visibility, Type, Product, SKU, and Action. However, the actual review content is cut off at the bottom. Let me scroll down to see the full reviews.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Great! I can now see one of the reviews! This is a negative review from Hannah Lim dated Apr 24, 2023, with status "Pending" and titled "Bad!". The review says:

"I was really disappointed with the Circe Hooded Ice Fleece. The material is not very high quality and started pilling after just one wash. The fit was also really strange - the sleeves were too short and the body was too baggy, making me look frumpy. I was hoping this would be a cozy layer for winter walks, but it doesn't keep me very warm either. Finally, the hood is way too big and just falls down over my face. I wouldn't recommend this product - there are much better options out there for the price."

This is a NEGATIVE review, not a positive one showing why customers like the product. I need to find more reviews, especially positive ones that explain why customers like Circe's products. Let me scroll up to see if there's another review, since it said "2 records found".
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'direction': 'up', 'distance': 'medium'}
[result] Scrolled up by medium distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Perfect! Now I can see the second review (ID 352) which is a POSITIVE review! This review is from "customer" dated Apr 24, 2023, with status "Pending" and titled "Good but not perfect". The review says:

"I recently purchased the Circe Hooded Ice Fleece and overall, I'm quite happy with it. The fleece material is incredibly soft and cozy, and I love the addition of the hood for extra warmth. The fit is true to size and the sleeves are long enough, which is often a problem for me. The only reason I'm not giving it a full 5 stars is because I was hoping the color would be a bit more vibrant - it's a bit muted compared to what I was expecting. But overall, I would definitely recommend the Circe Hooded Ice Fleece for anyone in need of a warm and comfortable layer for outdoor activities."

Now I need to see if there are more reviews. Since this page only shows 2 reviews and they're both for the same product (Circe Hooded Ice Fleece), let me check if there are reviews for other Circe products. Let me go to the "All Reviews" section from the Marketing menu to see all reviews across all products and filter for Circe products.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'MARKETING menu item in the left sidebar'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good, the Marketing menu is open. Let me click on "All Reviews" to see all reviews in the system.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'All Reviews option in the Marketing menu'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Let me wait for the page to load.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__wait: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'duration': 2000}
[result] Finished waiting for 2000ms. {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
It seems the page hasn't changed. Let me close the Marketing menu and try navigating directly. Let me press Escape to close the menu first.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__press_key: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'keys': ['escape']}
[result] Keys pressed successfully
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__screenshot: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608'}
[result] {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
The menu is still open. Let me click the X button to close it.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'target': 'X close button in the top right corner of the Marketing menu'}
[result] Click action completed successfully {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! The menu is closed. Based on what I've found, I can see there are only 2 reviews for the Circe Hooded Ice Fleece product. However, I should check if there are more Circe products with reviews or if these are the only reviews available. Let me scroll down to see the second review again to make sure I have all the information.
[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {'boxId': '420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608', 'direction': 'down', 'distance': 'short'}
[result] Scrolled down by short distance {'type': 'image', 'source': {'data': '<image_bytes_removed>', 'media_type': 'image/png', 'type': 'base64'}}
Good! I can see the second review (ID 353) which is the negative review from Hannah Lim. Now I have seen both reviews for the Circe Hooded Ice Fleece. 

Based on my findings, I found only 2 reviews for Circe products, and only ONE of them is positive. From the positive review (ID 352), I can extract the reasons why customers like Circe's products:

**Reasons why customers like Circe's products (from the positive review):**
1. The fleece material is incredibly soft and cozy
2. The hood provides extra warmth
3. The fit is true to size
4. The sleeves are long enough
5. It's a warm and comfortable layer for outdoor activities
6. Overall recommended for outdoor activities

Let me complete the task with this information.

Now I can see 16 Circe products have been found. All of them appear to be "Circe Hooded Ice Fleece" products in various colors. However, to find out why customers like these products, I need to look at customer reviews. This admin interface shows product listings but not reviews. Let me check if there\'s a way to view reviews in the admin panel. Let me try accessing the MARKETING section to see if there\'s a reviews section, or I should check the actual customer-facing website to see reviews.\n\nActually, let me first check one of these products to see if there\'s a reviews section. Let me click on one of the Circe products.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'target\': \'Circe Hooded Ice Fleece product name in the first row\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI see the page is loading.

I\'m now on the "Circe Hooded Ice Fleece" product page. I can see various product details fields. Let me scroll down to see if there\'s a reviews section or any customer feedback information on this page.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'direction\': \'down\', \'distance\': \'medium\'}\n[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI can see more product attributes like Country of Manufacture, Activity, Style General, Material, and Sleeve. This is still product information but not customer reviews. Let me continue scrolling to see if there\'s a reviews section.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'direction\': \'down\', \'distance\': \'medium\'}\n[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI can see more product attributes including Collar, Pattern, Climate, Color, Eco Collection, Performance Fabric, and Erin Recommends. Still no reviews section.

This might mean there are no reviews for this product in the admin panel, or the reviews need to be accessed differently. Let me try checking the MARKETING section in the sidebar to see if there\'s a dedicated Reviews management area, or I should access the customer-facing website to see actual reviews.\n\nLet me click on the MARKETING section in the left sidebar.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'target\': \'MARKETING menu item in the left sidebar\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nExcellent! I can see the Marketing menu has opened and there are two important options: "All Reviews" and "Pending Reviews". I can also see at the bottom of the page that "2 records found" which suggests there are reviews. Let me click on "All Reviews" to see all the reviews.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'target\': \'All Reviews option in the Marketing menu\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nI can see the page is loading and shows "2 records found" at the bottom.

I can see a table with columns for ID, Created, Status, Title, Nickname, Review, Visibility, Type, Product, SKU, and Action. However, the actual review content is cut off at the bottom. Let me scroll down to see the full reviews.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'direction\': \'down\', \'distance\': \'medium\'}\n[result] Scrolled down by medium distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGreat! I can now see one of the reviews! This is a negative review from Hannah Lim dated Apr 24, 2023, with status "Pending" and titled "Bad!". The review says:\n\n"I was really disappointed with the Circe Hooded Ice Fleece. The material is not very high quality and started pilling after just one wash. The fit was also really strange - the sleeves were too short and the body was too baggy, making me look frumpy. I was hoping this would be a cozy layer for winter walks, but it doesn\'t keep me very warm either. Finally, the hood is way too big and just falls down over my face. I wouldn\'t recommend this product - there are much better options out there for the price."\n\nThis is a NEGATIVE review, not a positive one showing why customers like the product. I need to find more reviews, especially positive ones that explain why customers like Circe\'s products. Let me scroll up to see if there\'s another review, since it said "2 records found".\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'direction\': \'up\', \'distance\': \'medium\'}\n[result] Scrolled up by medium distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nPerfect! Now I can see the second review (ID 352) which is a POSITIVE review! This review is from "customer" dated Apr 24, 2023, with status "Pending" and titled "Good but not perfect". The review says:\n\n"I recently purchased the Circe Hooded Ice Fleece and overall, I\'m quite happy with it. The fleece material is incredibly soft and cozy, and I love the addition of the hood for extra warmth. The fit is true to size and the sleeves are long enough, which is often a problem for me. The only reason I\'m not giving it a full 5 stars is because I was hoping the color would be a bit more vibrant - it\'s a bit muted compared to what I was expecting. But overall, I would definitely recommend the Circe Hooded Ice Fleece for anyone in need of a warm and comfortable layer for outdoor activities."\n\nNow I need to see if there are more reviews. Since this page only shows 2 reviews and they\'re both for the same product (Circe Hooded Ice Fleece), let me check if there are reviews for other Circe products. Let me go to the "All Reviews" section from the Marketing menu to see all reviews across all products and filter for Circe products.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__click: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'target\': \'MARKETING menu item in the left sidebar\'}\n[result] Click action completed successfully {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood, the Marketing menu is open.

The menu is closed. Based on what I\'ve found, I can see there are only 2 reviews for the Circe Hooded Ice Fleece product. However, I should check if there are more Circe products with reviews or if these are the only reviews available. Let me scroll down to see the second review again to make sure I have all the information.\n[tool] mcp__gbox-browser__scroll: {\'boxId\': \'420081b1-5de0-417b-a905-7058c1ce0608\', \'direction\': \'down\', \'distance\': \'short\'}\n[result] Scrolled down by short distance {\'type\': \'image\', \'source\': {\'data\': \'<image_bytes_removed>\', \'media_type\': \'image/png\', \'type\': \'base64\'}}\nGood! I can see the second review (ID 353) which is the negative review from Hannah Lim. Now I have seen both reviews for the Circe Hooded Ice Fleece. \n\nBased on my findings, I found only 2 reviews for Circe products, and only ONE of them is positive. From the positive review (ID 352), I can extract the reasons why customers like Circe\'s products:\n\n**Reasons why customers like Circe\'s products (from the positive review):**\n1.
