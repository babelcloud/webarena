Based on what I've gathered:
- I'm in the Men's Shoes category (Shoes subcategory under Men)

- I can see there are 523 products under $30 (66 items $0-$9.99 + 177 items $10-$19.99 + 280 items $20-$29.99)

The page currently shows men's shoes under $100, but I need to specifically show only items under $30. Looking at the task objective: "Show me products under $30 in 'men shoes' category" - I believe the user wants to see the filtered results displayed.

1. Navigated to the Men's Shoes category
2. Sorted by price (lowest to highest)
