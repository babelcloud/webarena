**Location**: Reports > Customers > Order Total

**Description**: 
The Order Total Report shows a list of all customers with their order statistics including:
- Customer name
- Number of orders (the "Orders" column shows the count)
- Average order amount
- Total order amount

You can filter by date range or show all historical data, and the report displays customers sorted with their order counts.

**Alternative Path**: 
Reports > Customers > Order Count (shows similar data with order counts per customer)

**Documentation URLs**:
- https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-admin/start/reporting/customer-reports

**Additional Context**: 
- Use the "From/To" date fields at the top - leave them broad or empty to see entire order history
- The "Orders" column shows the exact number of orders each customer has placed
- You can export the repor...

I can also see we've reached the end - there's a "Total" row showing 166 total orders, and years 2024 and 2025 show "We can't find records for this period."

However, I notice this report is showing orders BY YEAR for each customer, not their total orders across all history. For example, I see "Jane Smith" appearing multiple times in different years. 

This means I need to look at the data differently. The issue is that this report breaks down orders by year for each customer, so a customer might have 2 orders in 2022 and 3 orders in 2021, giving them 5 total orders.

Let me try a different approach. Let me navigate to the Customers section directly where I can see the complete customer list with their total order counts. Let me use the Magento Admin subagent again to find where to see total order counts per customer across all time.

2025-10-29 12:49:06,464 - INFO - 📥 [⏱️ 18.22s exec] Tool result: Based on the documentation, I found the answer. Let me provide you with the complete information:

**Location**: Reports > Customers > Order Total

**Description**: 
The Order Total Report shows customer orders with the number of orders per customer. However, this report is TIME-BASED and breaks down orders by intervals (Day/Month/Year). To see LIFETIME totals without time breakdown:

1. Go to Reports > Customers > Order Total
2. Set the date range (From/To) to cover your entire business history
3. Change "Show By" to "Year" (this will give you the largest aggregation interval)
4. The "Orders" column shows the order count for each customer in that period

**IMPORTANT LIMITATION**: The documentation shows that both the "Order Total Report" and "Order Count Report" (Reports > Customers > Order Count) always include an "Interval" column that breaks data by Day/Month/Year. There doesn't appear to be a true "lifetime total" view that completely removes time intervals.

**Best Workaround**:

2025-10-29 12:52:24,953 - INFO - 💬 I'm back on the Order Total Report page, but it's reset to default settings (Day view, no date range). Based on my previous viewing of this report with the full date range, I noticed that the report shows customers' order counts broken down by year. Some customers appeared multiple times across different years.

Looking back at my screenshots, I saw customers who had exactly 2 orders in a single year. However, I need to identify which customer has EXACTLY 2 orders in their ENTIRE history (not per year).

Let me think about this differently. From what I observed:
- Many customers appeared with order counts in 2021, 2022, and 2023
- I saw several customers with 2 orders in specific years (Katie Wong, Jane Snath, Lisa Kim, Brian Smith, Alexander Thomas in 2022; John Smith, Ava Brown, Lily Potter, Alex Martin, Samantha Jones, Bob Jones in 2023, and Adam Garcia in 2023)

The key insight is: if a customer only appears ONCE in the entire report with an order count of 2, then they have exactly 2 orders total. But if they appear in multiple years, I need to sum their orders.

Let me try a different approach. Let me check the "Order Count" report instead, which might give me a clearer view.

2025-10-29 12:53:31,994 - INFO - 💬 Let me think about this more carefully. Looking at the data I collected from the Order Total Report earlier, I need to manually analyze which customers have exactly 2 orders total across all years.

From my earlier screenshots, I noticed that:
- In 2022, I saw: Katie Wong (2), Jane Snath (2), Lisa Kim (2), Brian Smith (2), Alexander Thomas (2)
- In 2023, I saw: John Smith (2), Ava Brown (2), Lily Potter (2), Alex Martin (2), Samantha Jones (2), Bob Jones (2), Adam Garcia (2)

However, many customers appeared in MULTIPLE years. For example:
- In 2021, I saw Ava Brown (5) and Lily Potter (3)
- In 2023, I saw Ava Brown (2) and Lily Potter (2)

This means Ava Brown has 5+2=7 orders total, and Lily Potter has 3+2=5 orders total.

The key is to find customers who ONLY appear once in the entire report with exactly 2 orders, OR customers whose order counts across all years sum to exactly 2.

Let me navigate to the Sales > Orders section to see if I can get a better view of all orders and filter by customer.

I can see multiple orders from Veronica Costello and Sophie Taylor already visible. To find which customer has exactly 2 orders total, I could manually count orders per customer by looking at the Bill-to Name column. However, with 308 orders, this would be tedious.

Let me use the Filters feature to help organize this data. But actually, thinking about this more strategically - if I could group/count orders by customer name, that would be ideal. Let me check if there's a way to export or view a summary.

Actually, let me try a simpler approach. Looking back at my data from the Order Total Report, I need to find customers who only appeared ONCE across all years with exactly 2 orders. Let me carefully review my screenshots mentally:

From the Order Total Report (2022 section), customers with 2 orders who I saw were:
- Katie Wong: 2
- Jane Snath: 2  
- Lisa Kim: 2
- Brian Smith: 2
- Alexander Thomas: 2

Let me check if any of these appeared in other years. From my 2021 screenshot, I don't recall seeing these names. From my 2023 screenshot, I need to verify if any of these appeared there too.

Let me use the search function on this Orders page to count orders for one of these candidates. Let me search for "Katie Wong".

3. Order 000000139 - Aug 28, 2022
4. Order 000000175 - Feb 13, 2022
5. Order 000000198 - Apr 30, 2022

So Katie Wong has **5 orders total**, not 2. The 2 orders I saw in the report must have been for a specific year only.

Let me try another candidate. Let me search for "Lisa Kim".

Let me try "Alexander Thomas" next.

Let me try "Jane Snath" - wait, I think I saw "Jane Snath" in my earlier screenshot. Let me search for that exact name.

2025-10-29 12:58:49,371 - INFO - 💬 The search returned "30 records found" but I see "Jane Smith" in the results, not "Jane Snath". This suggests the keyword search is matching partial names. This means there might not be a customer named "Jane Snath" - I may have misread the name in the report earlier.

Let me try a different approach. Let me search for "Samantha Nguyen" since I saw that name with 1 order in my earlier screenshot, and I want to find someone with exactly 2 orders.

2025-10-29 12:59:38,473 - INFO - 💬 Good! The search shows "45 records found" and I can see both "Samantha Nguyen" and "Samantha Jones" in the results. So Samantha Nguyen appears to have many orders (part of the 45 total).

Looking back at my earlier data from the Order Total Report, I recall seeing that Samantha Nguyen had 1 order in 2022. But this search shows she has multiple orders across different years.

Let me try searching for "Veronica Costello" since I saw her in the first Orders page with 2 orders visible.

I can see her two orders:
1. Order 000000001 - Mar 29, 2022 - $36.39 - Canceled
2. Order 000000002 - Apr 24, 2022 - $39.64 - Closed
