Since I don't see a rating sort option, let me try using the price filter on the left to narrow down to products under $20, and then manually look for the highest rated ones. Let me click on the price range "$0.00 - $999.99" to see products in that range.

I can see this is the first page (pagination shows 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 at the bottom). However, I need to find the HIGHEST rated product. Looking at what I've seen so far, I have limited data. Since there's no sort by rating option, I'll need to use the Advanced Search to be more systematic.
