3. **[Feature suggestion] Color theme slider** - created 2 years ago, labels: "feature", "help wanted", updated 2 years ago

The task asks me to find my **latest created issue that has feature in its title**. I need to check the "Created date" sorting to make sure I'm seeing them in the correct order. I can see the "Created date" dropdown on the right. Let me check if there are more recent issues by looking at the sort order. The top issue shows "created 2 years ago", but I need to verify this is sorted by creation date in descending order (newest first).

Good! It's already sorted by "Created date". Now I need to check if it's sorting in descending order (newest first) or ascending order (oldest first). Looking at the issues, I see:

- Second issue: created 2 years ago
- Fourth issue: created 3 years ago

2. **[Feature suggestion] Add a submission form** - created 2 years ago  
3. **[Feature suggestion] Color theme slider** - created 2 years ago

I also notice there's an icon next to the "Created date" dropdown - it appears to be showing the sort direction. I can see there's a sort direction toggle button (two arrows icon) next to "Created date". The current sorting shows 2 years ago at the top, then 3 years, then 4 years, which means it's sorted newest first (descending order).

Based on what I can see, the three "Feature suggestion" issues at the top were all created "2 years ago". Since they all have the same creation time display, I need to click on the first one to check if it's closed. The task says "latest created issue that has feature in its title", so I should click on the **first** one: "[Feature suggestion] WCAG trash panda mode".
