Since the website is "One Stop Market" and I'm logged into this account, all these orders should be from One Stop Market. However, I need to verify the exact amounts and ensure I'm counting only the orders from Jan-March 2023.

From page 1, I can see:
- 3/11/23: $65.32 (Complete)
- 3/10/23: $17.99 (Complete)

- 1/16/23: $132.24 (Complete)

Now I need to determine if I should include canceled orders or only completed orders. The task asks "how much I spend," which typically means completed transactions. However, let me check one of the orders to better understand the order details and confirm what categories they fall under. Let me view one of the March orders first.

- Grand Total: $65.32

This confirms that the order total shown in the order list ($65.32) includes shipping and handling. Now I understand that all these orders from One Stop Market are general shopping orders. Since the task asks about "shopping at One Stop Market," and this is the One Stop Market website, all orders should count.

However, I should check if there are any specific categories I should exclude. Looking at the order, it contains various items (phone case, cake toppers, corn muffin mix, etc.) which are all general shopping items. Since the task doesn't specify to exclude any particular type of items, I should include all completed orders.

Now, let me go back to compile the complete list. Let me navigate back to the orders page.

Based on the instructions, I should only count completed orders (not canceled or pending ones), as those are the ones where money was actually spent.

From the orders I've seen:

**March 2023:**
- 3/11/23: $65.32 (Complete) ✓
- 3/10/23: $17.99 (Complete) ✓

**February 2023:**
- 2/27/23: $762.18 (Complete) ✓
- 2/24/23: $231.54 (Canceled) ✗
- 2/11/23: $174.99 (Canceled) ✗
- 2/9/23: $185.32 (Complete) ✓

**January 2023:**
- 1/29/23: $440.64 (Complete) ✓
- 1/16/23: $132.24 (Complete) ✓

Now let me calculate the spending by month:
- **January 2023:** $440.64 + $132.24 = $572.88
- **February 2023:** $762.18 + $185.32 = $947.50
- **March 2023:** $65.32 + $17.99 = $83.31

The task asks "How much I spend each month from Jan to the end of March 2023" which suggests they want a breakdown by month. Let me provide the answer in the format that shows spending for each month.

- **February 2023:** $947.50 (2 completed orders) 
- **March 2023:** $83.31 (2 completed orders)

I only counted completed orders as these represent actual spending. Canceled orders were excluded as no money was spent on those.
