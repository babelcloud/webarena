2025-10-25 21:14:18,209 - INFO - 💬 Perfect! I can now see the issues list. I can see that there are 21 open issues, and the page is currently showing them. I notice there's a dropdown for "Updated date" which suggests these are sorted by update date. Let me check if these are already sorted by most recent. I can see all issues have "updated 2 years ago" or "updated 3 years ago" text.

However, I need to make sure I'm seeing the most recently updated issues. The dropdown says "Updated date" which suggests I might be able to sort by this. Let me check the current sorting by looking at the dates more carefully.

Looking at the list:
- Most issues show "updated 2 years ago"
- Some show "updated 3 years ago"

It appears the issues showing "updated 2 years ago" are at the top, which suggests they might already be sorted by most recent updates. However, to be thorough and see the actual most recent open issues, let me click on the "Updated date" dropdown to see if there are more recent sorting options.

2025-10-25 21:14:28,871 - INFO - 💬 Good! I can see a dropdown menu with sorting options. I can see that "Updated date" is currently selected (it has a checkmark). This means the issues are already sorted by updated date. However, I need to verify if this is showing the most recent first or oldest first. Let me close this dropdown and examine the issues more carefully to understand the current order.

2025-10-25 21:15:25,780 - INFO - 💬 Perfect! I'm back at the top of the issues list. I can see the most recent open issues sorted by "Updated date". The task asks me to "check out the most recent open issues" - this appears to be a browsing task where I need to view/examine the recent issues, which I've now done.

Looking at the current page, I can see the issues are sorted with the most recently updated at the top (all showing "updated 2 years ago"). The visible issues from most recent include:

1. ActionList: Needs better guidelines on not using single select items (#260)
2. Add guidelines for loading patterns (#300)
3. Add documentation on using Flash alerts in dialog components (#104)
4. Add dialogs to Messaging section (#105)
5. Path alias doesn't work (#33)
6. Incorrect path (URL) to `css-utilities` under `../design/foundations` (#355)
7. Spinners: Create guidelines for using the correct size in it's context (#372)
8. Truncation page has been removed, but not from navigation menu (#334)
9. Add clearing guidelines for SelectPanel/SelectMenu with single/multi selections (#229)
10. Alert dialog guidelines (#295)
11. Clarify usage of flash alert (#316)
12. Link to Primer Mobile Figma library is broken

Since the task is to "check out the most recent open issues" and I have successfully navigated to the issues page and can see them sorted by most recent updates, the task has been completed. The most recent open issues are now displayed on screen.
