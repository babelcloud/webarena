   - Very lightweight
   - Comfortable
   - Good quality

2. **Review by Pura**: "Wore these for a year and they started falling apart. For the price I guess I'll just get another pair cuz I do like them. But I think a shoe should last longer. It's not like I can take my sneakers to a cobbler haha" - Despite some durability concerns, the customer mentions they "do like them" and would buy again, suggesting:
   - Good value for the price
   - They like the product enough to repurchase despite durability issues
