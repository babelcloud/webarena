That's 5 commits by Steven Woodson (note: "Steve Woodson" and "Steven Woodson" appear to be the same person based on the avatar). Let me verify this count is correct by checking if there are exactly 13 commits visible between the "06 Feb, 2023" header and the "05 Feb, 2023" header.

I can count: 13 commits total on February 6, 2023, and 5 of them are by Steven Woodson (Steve Woodson).
