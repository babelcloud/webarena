2025-10-26 09:03:59,595 - INFO - 💬 Good! I can see I'm on a GitLab dashboard showing projects. I can see the "Yours" tab is selected (showing 19 projects). I need to find repositories where I made contributions that got the most stars. 

Looking at the current view, I can see several projects with star counts:
- a11y-syntax-highlighting: 1 star
- a11y-webring.club: 2 stars
- The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com: 21 stars
- accessible-html-content-patterns: 1 star
- And several with 0 stars

I also see at the bottom there's a "Primer / design" project with 21 stars. However, I need to check if these are repositories where I made contributions (as opposed to my own repositories). Let me scroll down to see all projects and identify which ones have the most stars.

2025-10-26 09:04:26,036 - INFO - 💬 Good, I can see more projects now. I notice:
- Primer / design: 21 stars (Developer role)
- empathy-prompts: 6 stars (Owner)
- millennials-to-snake-people: 6 stars (Owner)

Most others have 0-2 stars. Now I need to distinguish between:
1. Projects where I'm the Owner (my own projects)
2. Projects where I'm a Developer/Maintainer/Contributor (where I made contributions to someone else's project)

The key ones where I made contributions (not Owner) appear to be:
- Primer / design: 21 stars (Developer)
- The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com: 21 stars (Maintainer)

Let me scroll back up to see all the projects and make sure I have the complete list, especially to verify the roles and star counts.

2025-10-26 09:04:53,595 - INFO - 💬 Perfect! Now I can see the key projects. Let me analyze the repositories where I made contributions (not Owner):

From what I can see:
1. **The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com** - 21 stars (Maintainer role)
2. **Primer / design** - 21 stars (Developer role)

These are the two repositories where I made contributions (as opposed to being the Owner) and they both have 21 stars, which is the highest star count among the contributed repositories.

However, I should check if there are any other projects I might have missed. Let me click on one of these to verify the full repository name, and also check if there's a way to see only contributed projects or sort by stars to make sure I have the complete picture.

Let me click on "The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com" to see its full details:

2025-10-26 09:05:45,610 - INFO - 💬 Perfect! I can see the repository name is **design** (Primer / design) and it has 21 stars. 

Now I have confirmed the two repositories where I made contributions (not as Owner) that have the most stars:

1. **The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com** - 21 stars (Maintainer)
2. **Primer / design** - 21 stars (Developer)

Both have 21 stars, which is the highest among repositories where I contributed (but am not the Owner). However, I should verify if there are any other contributed repositories I might have missed. Let me go back to the projects page and check if there are any other projects with a role other than "Owner" that might have more stars or that I haven't seen yet.

2025-10-26 09:06:09,656 - INFO - 💬 Perfect! I can now see the end of the list. Let me review all the projects I've seen and identify which ones have a role OTHER than "Owner":

From the complete list:
1. **The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com** - 21 stars (Maintainer)
2. **Primer / design** - 21 stars (Developer)

All other visible projects show "Owner" as the role, which means they are my own repositories, not repositories where I made contributions to someone else's project.

Both repositories where I made contributions have 21 stars each, which is tied for the most stars. These are the repositories where I contributed and they got the most stars.

Now I have the answer:
- **The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com** (also shown as just "a11yproject.com")
- **Primer / design** (also shown as just "design")

2. **Primer / design** - 21 stars

Both repositories are tied with 21 stars each, making them the most-starred repositories among those where you contributed.
