2. ID 349 - Title: "OKish" by seam miller - Review: "I have to say, I'm not impressed with the Oliv..."

Both appear to be negative reviews based on the titles and preview text. Now I need to check if there are any more reviews by scrolling or checking if there are more pages. I can see it says "1 of 1" at the bottom, so these are all the pending reviews.

- **Detailed Rating**: 1 star
- **Status**: Pending
- **Summary of Review**: "won't recommand"
- **Full Review**: "I was really disappointed with the Olivia 1/4 Zip Light Jacket. The material is extremely thin and flimsy, which makes it not very warm at all. I was hoping for something that would keep me comfortable in the springtime, but this jacket just doesn't cut it. Additionally, the sizing is way off - I ordered my usual size and it was way too tight in the arms and shoulders. I had to return it and won't be buying from this brand again."

This is definitely a negative review (2 stars). I can see there's a "Delete Review" button at the top. Let me click it to delete this review.

2025-10-26 19:29:06,590 - INFO - 💬 Perfect! I can now see the details of the second review (ID 349):

- **Summary Rating**: 3 stars (out of 5)
- **Detailed Rating**: 3 stars
- **Status**: Pending
- **Summary of Review**: "OKish"
- **Full Review**: "I have to say, I'm not impressed with the Olivia 1/4 Zip Light Jacket. The color is not as vibrant as it looked online, and the zipper is really hard to use. The jacket is also not very breathable, so I found myself getting really sweaty when I wore it for even a short amount of time. Finally, the pockets are really shallow and not very functional. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this jacket - there are better options out there for the price."

This review has a 3-star rating. While it's not a glowing review and contains criticism, a 3-star rating is typically considered "neutral" or "mixed" rather than strictly negative. However, the content is clearly negative ("I'm not impressed", "I wouldn't recommend"). 

Typically, "negative reviews" are defined as reviews with ratings below a certain threshold (usually 3 stars or below, sometimes only 1-2 stars). Since the task is to delete "all pending negative reviews," I need to determine if 3-star reviews count as negative. Given the negative language in the review content and that 3 stars is typically the borderline, I'll delete this one as well to be thorough.

This confirms that all pending reviews have been deleted. I successfully deleted both pending negative reviews:

1. **Review ID 351** - 2-star review by Emma with title "won't recommand" - complained about the Olivia 1/4 Zip Light Jacket being thin, flimsy, not warm, and having sizing issues.

2. **Review ID 349** - 3-star review by seam miller with title "OKish" - stated they were not impressed with the Olivia 1/4 Zip Light Jacket, wouldn't recommend it, and had issues with color, zipper, breathability, and pockets.
