However, I see labels like "Owner", "Maintainer", "Developer" which indicate my role. The task asks for repositories where I made **contributions**. Let me think about this:

1. Being an "Owner" means I created/own the repository
2. The task asks for repositories where I made "contributions"

I need to check if there are more repositories below and also understand if "contributions" means I contributed to someone else's repository or if it includes repositories I own. Let me scroll down to see all 14 projects first to get the complete list.

2025-11-03 15:49:51,809 - INFO - 💬 Perfect! Now I can see more repositories. Let me compile the complete list of repositories with 0 stars. I notice the task asks for repositories where "I made contributions" - this could mean either repositories I own/contribute to, or specifically repositories where I'm a contributor (not owner). 

Since this is under the "Yours" tab (showing 14 projects), these are all repositories where I have some involvement. Let me check if I need to look at the contribution history to determine which ones I actually contributed to, or if the presence under "Yours" tab counts as contributions.

Looking at the repositories with 0 stars visible on screen:
- **Byte Blaze / cloud-to-butt** - ★ 0, Owner
- **Byte Blaze / dotfiles** - ★ 0, Owner
- **Byte Blaze / gimmiethat.space** - ★ 0, Owner
- **Byte Blaze / remove-board-movement-events-from-the-github-issue-timeline** - ★ 0, Owner
- **Byte Blaze / solarized-prism-theme** - ★ 0, Owner
- **Byte Blaze / timeit** - ★ 0, Owner

However, I also notice "Primer / design" which shows "Developer" role - this means I'm a developer/contributor but not the owner. Let me check if there are any repositories where I'm listed as a contributor/developer (not owner) that have 0 stars, as that might be what the task is asking for.

Let me click on one of the repositories to check the contributions more carefully, or let me look for a way to see my actual contributions. Let me click on my profile or check if there's a contributions view.

6. **remove-board-movement-events-from-the-github-issue-timeline** - ★ 0

Now let me understand the task better. The task asks for "repositories where I made contributions and they got no stars". 

Looking at the "Contributed projects" tab, I only contributed to **The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com** which has 21 stars, so that doesn't meet the criteria.

However, the "Personal projects" are projects I own/created. The question is whether creating/owning a project counts as "making contributions" to it. In typical GitLab/GitHub terminology:
- **Contributed projects** = projects where I contributed but don't own
- **Personal projects** = projects I own/created

Since I found NO repositories in the "Contributed projects" tab with 0 stars, and the only project there has 21 stars, let me verify if the task is asking about personal projects where I made contributions (as the owner/creator).

Let me go back to check if there's another interpretation. Let me click on the "Contributed projects" tab again to make absolutely sure I didn't miss anything.

**The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com** - ★ 21 stars

This project has 21 stars, NOT 0 stars.

So the answer is clear: There are NO repositories in the "Contributed projects" section that have 0 stars. The only repository I contributed to (where I'm not the owner) has 21 stars.

However, let me reconsider the interpretation. The task says "repositories where I made contributions and they got no stars". In GitLab/GitHub terminology:
- Making "contributions" typically means contributing code through commits, merge requests, etc.
- This can include both repositories you own AND repositories owned by others

Let me think about this differently. Perhaps the task wants me to consider ALL repositories where I made contributions (including my own personal projects where I'm the owner, since owners obviously contribute to their own projects).

In that case, from the "Personal projects" section, the repositories with 0 stars where I (as owner) made contributions are:

1. **Byte Blaze / dotfiles** - ★ 0
2. **Byte Blaze / timeit** - ★ 0
3. **Byte Blaze / solarized-prism-theme** - ★ 0
4. **Byte Blaze / gimmiethat.space** - ★ 0
5. **Byte Blaze / cloud-to-butt** - ★ 0
6. **Byte Blaze / remove-board-movement-events-from-the-github-issue-timeline** - ★ 0

Let me verify this is the complete list by checking the "Personal projects" section once more. Let me click on that tab.

So the complete list of personal projects with 0 stars is:

1. **dotfiles** - ★ 0
2. **timeit** - ★ 0
3. **solarized-prism-theme** - ★ 0
4. **gimmiethat.space** - ★ 0
5. **cloud-to-butt** - ★ 0
6. **remove-board-movement-events-from-the-github-issue-timeline** - ★ 0

Now, since the task asks for "repositories where I made contributions", I need to understand if this means:
1. Only repositories where I contributed but don't own (from "Contributed projects" tab) - in which case the answer would be "none" or empty
2. All repositories where I made contributions including ones I own - in which case it's the 6 repositories listed above

Given the phrasing "where I made contributions", I believe the most reasonable interpretation is ALL repositories where I contributed (including my own projects, since as an owner I obviously made contributions). 

However, I need to provide the FULL NAMES of the repositories. Let me check if I need to include the full path. Looking at the screen, I can see the projects are shown as just the repository name (like "dotfiles", "timeit", etc.) since they're all under "Byte Blaze".

But let me verify the full names by clicking on one repository to see its full name format.

2025-11-03 15:52:57,472 - INFO - 💬 Perfect! Now I can see the repository page. I can see:
- The breadcrumb shows: **Byte Blaze > dotfiles**
- The repository name at the top is: **dotfiles**
- It shows **0 Star** and **0 Fork**

So the full name format is "Byte Blaze / dotfiles". Let me go back to the personal projects page to compile the complete list with full names. Let me use the back button.

2025-11-03 15:53:15,150 - INFO - 💬 Good! I'm back on the Personal projects page. Now let me scroll down to see all the repositories with 0 stars and compile the complete list with their full names.

From what I can see on the current screen with 0 stars:
1. **Byte Blaze / dotfiles** - ★ 0
2. **Byte Blaze / timeit** - ★ 0
3. **Byte Blaze / solarized-prism-theme** - ★ 0
4. **Byte Blaze / gimmiethat.space** - ★ 0
5. **Byte Blaze / cloud-to-butt** - ★ 0

Let me scroll down to see the remaining one.

2025-11-03 15:53:28,051 - INFO - 💬 Perfect! Now I can see the 6th repository:

6. **Byte Blaze / remove-board-movement-events-from-the-github-issue-timeline** - ★ 0

So the complete list of repositories where I made contributions (as owner) and they have 0 stars:

1. Byte Blaze / dotfiles
2. Byte Blaze / timeit
3. Byte Blaze / solarized-prism-theme
4. Byte Blaze / gimmiethat.space
5. Byte Blaze / cloud-to-butt
6. Byte Blaze / remove-board-movement-events-from-the-github-issue-timeline

Now I need to provide the answer. The task asks for "full names of the repositories". Based on the format I saw, the full names include the owner/organization name followed by the repository name.
