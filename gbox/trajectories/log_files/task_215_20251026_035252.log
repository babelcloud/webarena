"I was really disappointed with the Circe Hooded Ice Fleece. The material is not very high quality and started pilling after just one wash. The fit was also really strange - the sleeves were too short and the body was too baggy, making me look frumpy. I was hoping this would be a cozy layer for winter walks, but it doesn't keep me very warm either. Finally, the hood is way too big and just falls down over my face. I wouldn't recommend this product - there are much better options out there for the price."

"I recently purchased the Circe Hooded Ice Fleece and overall, I'm quite happy with it. The fleece material is incredibly soft and cozy, and I love the addition of the hood for extra warmth. The fit is true to size and the sleeves are long enough, which is often a problem for me. The only reason I'm not giving it a full 5 stars is because I was hoping the color would be a bit more vibrant - it's a bit muted compared to what I was expecting. But overall, I would definitely recommend the Circe Hooded Ice Fleece for anyone in need of a warm and comfortable layer for outdoor activities."
