The left panel shows:
- **name**: Shanksville
- **border_type**: borough

The map on the right shows the town of Shanksville with its boundaries clearly marked. This is the page for Shanksville, which is the place in Pennsylvania associated with the September 11th plane crash (United Airlines Flight 93 crashed near this town in Stonycreek Township).

However, I realize the task asks for "the place in Pennsylvania where a plane crashed" - and while Shanksville is commonly associated with it, the Wikipedia research confirmed the crash actually occurred in **Stonycreek Township**, not technically within Shanksville itself (it was near Shanksville).

Let me check the current URL to see what page I'm on. The URL shows: `http://ec2-3-149-78-74.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:3000/relation/189076`

This is the page for Shanksville (relation/189076). Given that the task is asking for "the page of the place" and Shanksville is the most commonly referenced location for the Flight 93 crash site (even though technically it was in nearby Stonycreek Township), and this is a complete page showing the location on the map, I should provide this URL as the answer.
