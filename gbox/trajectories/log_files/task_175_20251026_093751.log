2. **"Remove unused vendor dependencies"** (Closed) - Byte Blaze / empathy-prompts #5 - created 8 years ago by Byte Blaze - **updated 2 years ago**

3. **"Remove Gulp as a dependency"** (Open) - The A11Y Project / a11yproject.com #989 - created 5 years ago by Byte Blaze - **updated 2 years ago**

4. **"drbbdup does not restore regs at last instruction of a rep-expanded block"** (Open) - DynamoRIO / dynamorio #5906 - created 2 years ago by prasun3 - **updated 2 years ago**

5. **"Add instruction encoding entries to drmemtrace"** (Closed) - DynamoRIO / dynamorio #5520 - created 3 years ago by Derek Bruening - **updated 2 years ago**

6. **"Reduce glibc dependences in drrun to operate on older distros"** (Closed) - DynamoRIO / dynamorio #5474 - created 3 years ago by Derek Bruening - **updated 2 years ago**

All of these show "updated 2 years ago". Now I need to identify which issues are MINE (created by me or assigned to me). Looking at the creators, I can see "Byte Blaze" appears to be the user. Let me look for issues specifically with "dependency" (singular) in the title that are mine.

The first issue "Outdated dependencies" is:
- Created by: Byte Blaze
- Project: Byte Blaze / empathy-prompts #18
- Status: Open (green label)
- Updated: 2 years ago

This appears to be the latest updated issue with "dependenc" in the title that belongs to Byte Blaze. Now I need to click on this issue to check its full details and confirm if it's closed or open.
