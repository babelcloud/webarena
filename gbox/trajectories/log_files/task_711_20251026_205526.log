I notice in the yellow information box at the top, it says "Last updated: Jun 10, 2023, 10:05:19 PM. To refresh last day's statistics, click here." This suggests I may need to refresh the statistics.

However, the report still shows "0 records found" even after refreshing the statistics. This might mean there were no product views during the specified date range (07/05/2021 to 05/31/2023), or the data might not have been tracked during that period.

Let me scroll down to see if there's any data in the table below, as sometimes the message at the top might not update correctly.

2025-10-26 20:57:57,275 - INFO - 💬 I can confirm that the report table is indeed empty - it shows "We couldn't find any records." and "0 records found" even after scrolling down. The table has columns for Interval, Product, Price, and Views, but no data rows.

It appears that either:
1. There were no product views tracked during the period 07/05/2021 to 05/31/2023, or
2. The statistics for that historical period weren't collected/stored

However, I notice the task asks me to "Create a product view report" from those dates. The report interface has been set up with the correct date range, and the statistics have been refreshed. Since this is the Product Views Report page with the specified date range configured, this IS the created report - it just happens to have no data for that period.

But let me check if there might be a different interpretation. Perhaps I need to actually generate/save this report in some way. Let me scroll back up to see if there are any other options like saving or generating the report.
