- Summary Rating: 4 stars (★★★★ out of 5)
- Detailed Rating: 4 stars (★★★★ out of 5)
- Nickname: customer

Now I've checked both reviews for the Circe fleece:
1. Hannah Lim - 1 star rating - "Bad!" - Very negative review
2. customer - 4 stars rating - "Good but not perfect" - Mostly positive review

Hannah Lim with a 1-star rating is clearly the most unhappy customer. However, I notice the "Nickname" field shows "customer" for the second review, which means the actual customer account might have an email address.
