2025-10-25 18:39:58,038 - INFO - 💬 Perfect! I can now see the reviews section. I can see there are 12 reviews total. I can see two reviews so far:

1. "Decent ink gobbler" by GoldfishGoldfish (posted 4/20/23) - This is a long review about printer quality issues but doesn't mention customer service complaints.

2. "Printer heads clog quickly and cannot be unclogged easily" by J. B. Shirey II (posted 4/20/23) - This review talks about printer issues but also doesn't mention customer service complaints yet.

I need to scroll down to see more reviews and check if any mention complaints about customer service.

2025-10-25 18:40:15,023 - INFO - 💬 Excellent! I found two reviews that mention complaints about customer service:

1. **"Poorly designed, lousy performance"** by **Bob in Vegas** (posted 4/20/23) - This review explicitly states: "Their poor excuse for customer service is only exceeded by the terrible design and poor quality of their products."

2. **"ExcellentNON-COLOR printer!"** (I can see the beginning of this review which mentions issues with customer service - I can see text saying "was hoping they could do it online since most of my experience with technical support for computer stuff has been bad and I'm stressed enough. Well, needless to say I think I've had my intelligence insulted by Epson more times than I can handle. The person basically told me a list of things I should try to AVOID with my Epson printer; I never knew a lot of these things. Apparently their printer works better if you download what you need to print, save it first to your computer then print it-- instead of printing directly off the screen or website.However, the worst was when the person on the phone with customer service (I wanted to avoid this) asked me to take out the ink cartridges and read her the numbers")

Let me continue scrolling to see the rest of this review and check if there are more reviews mentioning customer service complaints.

The review states: "Her technical support is CLEARLY not customer support because her reasoning behind me getting a refurbished one is laughable, 'it's not like we can resell yours, it's defective'."
