Based on the information displayed on OpenStreetMap, I have successfully obtained the directions. The task asks to "show me the way" from Carnegie Mellon University to the home stadium of Boston's NBA team (TD Garden).

The answer should include the route information that OpenStreetMap is displaying. Since this is a routing/navigation task, the most appropriate answer format would be to provide the key details of the route. Let me take one more screenshot to capture the full route view and then provide the answer.

Let me zoom out a bit on the map to get a better view of the entire route, or I can provide the answer based on what I've seen. Actually, looking at the current view, I have all the necessary information. The URL in the browser also contains the route parameters, and the map clearly shows the path.

Based on the instructions, when asked about routing or "show me the way," I should provide the complete information as displayed. Let me provide the final answer with the route details.
