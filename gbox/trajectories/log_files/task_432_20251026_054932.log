2025-10-26 05:50:05,440 - INFO - 💬 Good! I can see there are 3 tabs open:
1. A "New Tab" (CDP URL - I won't switch to this one)
2. Ciclon Energy Drink - Regular 24 cans (8.3oz)
3. V8 +Energy - 8 Ounce Can, Pack of 24

I need to check both product tabs to compare their per unit prices. Let me start by switching to the Ciclon Energy Drink tab and taking a screenshot.

2025-10-26 05:50:14,473 - INFO - 💬 Perfect! I can see the first product:
- **Ciclon Energy Drink - Regular 24 cans (8.3oz)**
- Price: **$36.99**
- Quantity: 24 cans of 8.3oz each
- Per unit price: $36.99 / 24 = **$1.54 per can**

Now let me switch to the V8 +Energy tab to check its pricing.

- Price: **$14.47**
- Quantity: 24 cans of 8 ounces each
- Per unit price: $14.47 / 24 = **$0.60 per can**

Now I can compare the two products:
- **Ciclon Energy Drink**: $1.54 per can
- **V8 +Energy**: $0.60 per can ✓ (LOWEST)

The V8 +Energy has the lowest per unit price at $0.60 per can. I need to add this product to the shopping cart by clicking the "Add to Cart" button.

1. The button has changed from "Add to Cart" to "Added" (lighter blue/disabled state)
2. The cart icon in the top right now shows an orange badge with "1" indicating one item in the cart

The task has been completed successfully. I compared the two products from the open tabs:

- V8 +Energy: $14.47 for 24 cans = $0.60 per can (lowest)

And I've added the V8 +Energy product (the one with the lowest per unit price) to the shopping cart.
