- "Integrating LLMs for better prompts" - created 2 hours ago
- "401 bad gateway" - created 2 hours ago
- "[Feature suggestion] WCAG trash panda mode" - created 2 years ago

- "Better sharing solution" - created 8 years ago
- "Create an Offline page" - created 5 years ago
- "Link to WCAG 2.1 instead of 2.0" - created 3 years ago

I can see "Outdated dependencies" which contains the word "dependencies" in its title. However, I need to check if this is the LATEST created issue with "dependency" in the title. Let me scroll down to see if there are more issues, or I should look at the creation dates more carefully.

So far, I've found two issues with "dependency/dependencies" in their titles:
1. "Outdated dependencies" - created 4 years ago
2. "Remove Gulp as a dependency" - created 5 years ago

Between these two, "Outdated dependencies" (created 4 years ago) is more recent than "Remove Gulp as a dependency" (created 5 years ago). However, I should check if there are more pages to see if there are any newer issues. I can see pagination at the bottom showing "1" and "2" and "Next >". Let me scroll back up to see the earlier issues again and verify which one is the latest.

Actually, wait - I need to reconsider the sorting. The page shows "Updated date" in the sort dropdown. Let me check what the current sort order is and whether I need to sort by creation date instead. Let me click on the sort dropdown to see the options.

2. "Integrating LLMs for better prompts" - created 2 hours ago
3. "401 bad gateway" - created 2 hours ago

6. "[Feature suggestion] Color theme slider" - created 2 years ago
7. **"Outdated dependencies"** - created 4 years ago ← This has "dependencies" in the title!

The most recent issue with "dependency" in the title that I can see so far is "Outdated dependencies" created 4 years ago. However, I need to check if the sorting is descending (newest first) or ascending (oldest first). Looking at the order, it appears to be descending (newest first: 1 hour ago, then 2 hours ago, then 2 years ago, then 4 years ago).

But I should verify by looking at all issues to make sure there isn't a more recent one with "dependency" in the title. Let me search or filter specifically for issues with "dependency" in the title. Let me use the search functionality to filter for "dependency".

Let me type "dependency" in the search area to filter the issues.

Actually, I realize I should use the GitLab search functionality more efficiently. Let me look at the URL - it shows I'm viewing issues filtered by author (Byte Blaze) and sorted by created_date. I can add a search parameter to filter by title. Let me try using the search/filter area on the page itself.

However, looking at the current list sorted by creation date (newest first), and seeing:
- Recent issues from 1-4 hours ago
- Then issues from 2-3 years ago  
- Then "Outdated dependencies" created 4 years ago

Let me scroll through all the pages to find all issues with "dependency" in the title and identify which one was created most recently. But first, let me use a more efficient approach - I'll use the browser's find function to search for "dependen" on this page.
