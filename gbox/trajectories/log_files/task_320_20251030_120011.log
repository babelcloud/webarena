However, I noticed there was another cancelled order from February 2023 (Order #000000156 dated 2/24/23 with total $231.54). Let me go back and check if the task is asking about "order" (singular) or if there might be multiple orders. Let me scroll down first to see if there are any refund details on this page, then I'll check the other order as well to be thorough.

Let me go back to check the other one (Order #000000156 dated 2/24/23) to see if there are multiple cancelled orders from February 2023.

This order contains:
- Greaton Fully Assembled Split Wood Traditional Box Spring/Foundation For Mattress With Frame Set - Price: $226.54, Qty: 1, Subtotal: $226.54

Now I have both cancelled orders from February 2023:
1. Order #000000156 (2/24/23): $231.54 (including $5.00 shipping)
2. Order #000000158 (2/11/23): $174.99 (including $5.00 shipping)

According to the instructions (rule 11), the task wording can contain typos or singular/plural mismatches. The task says "my order canlled" (singular), but there are TWO cancelled orders from February 2023. The instructions state: "If multiple entries match the described criteria, summarize all of them, list each matching item with its key details, make the quantity explicit, and when the question asks for an amount/total, include the combined sum."

Since the task asks "How much refund I should expect from my order canlled in Feb 2023", and there are multiple cancelled orders from Feb 2023, I should provide the combined total:

**Total refund expected: $231.54 + $174.99 = $406.53**
