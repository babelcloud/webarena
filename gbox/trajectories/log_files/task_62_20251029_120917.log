**Location**: Reports > Customers > Order Total 
OR 
Customers > All Customers > [Customers Grid]

**Description**: 
1. The Customers grid (Customers > All Customers) has an "Orders" column that shows the total number of orders for each customer.
2. You can sort this column to quickly identify customers with the most orders.

**Documentation URLs**:
- https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-admin/customers/customers-menu/customers-all
- https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-admin/start/reporting/customer-reports

**Additional Context**:
- In the Customers grid, click on the "Orders" column header to sort from highest to lowest
- You can use filters to refine the list (e.g., by group, store view)
- Each customer's row shows their total order count at a glance

**Alternative Path**:

The "Bill-to Name" column shows the customer names. To find which customer has completed the most orders, I need to sort by the "Bill-to Name" column or use filters/export to analyze the data.

This manual counting approach will take too long with 308 orders. Let me use a more efficient method. Let me go back and use the "Status" filter to show only "Complete" orders (since the task asks for "completed" orders), and then manually count or use a better approach.
