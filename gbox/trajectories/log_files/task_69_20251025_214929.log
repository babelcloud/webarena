2025-10-25 21:52:13,088 - INFO - 💬 Perfect! I found the post about supporting local bookstores. The post is titled "Friendly reminder bookshop.org exists." and it contains very important information:

**Post content:**
"Saw it's been a few months since this website was discussed. I actually just discovered it last night. Local bookstores are so important and they have so much character we should all do what we can to support this.

This website allows you to select a local bookstore in your area and 30% of any book purchase on the website goes to the store.

I think it is amazing!"

**From the first comment (367 votes):**
"I'm a manager at an indie bookstore and I agree. Bookshop.org is wonderful! It honestly helped keep a lot of smaller indies alive during the pandemic.

I'd also encourage folks to checkout their local indie's website. It may promote things like free in-store events, indie-exclusive editions of new books, locally self-published authors, or signed bookplates. Plus a lot of them are unionized!

Thank you so much for supporting independent bookstores and have a wonderful new year."

So the post is about **Bookshop.org**, which is a website that supports local independent bookstores by giving them 30% of book purchases. Let me scroll down to see if there are any other organizations mentioned in the comments.
