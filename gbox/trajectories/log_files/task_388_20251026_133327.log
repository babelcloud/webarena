It started chipping right away. The ring holder was too tight and first, then it was nice for a while, then it loosened completely and just dangled from my phone so I had to immediately replace it.

- N Randall (2 stars)

This appears to be all 12 reviews for this specific product. So far I've found **2 reviewers with 2-star ratings**:
1. **Evelyn Kurver**
2. **N Randall**

However, the task asks about "phone cases from EYZUTAK" (plural), which might mean I should check if there are other EYZUTAK phone case products with 1 or 2 star reviews. Let me go back to the search results to check other products. Let me use the back button to return to the search results.

The task asks "Who gave 1 or 2 stars for phone cases from EYZUTAK". This likely means I should look across all EYZUTAK phone case products. However, checking 12,805 products individually isn't feasible.

Since the task is asking who gave 1 or 2 stars for phone cases from EYZUTAK, and I've found 2 people on the first product I checked, let me verify if there's a way to see ALL reviews across all EYZUTAK products, or if I should check a few more products to be thorough.

2025-10-26 13:36:44,139 - INFO - 💬 I can see the left sidebar has "Shopping Options" with a "Category" section, but I don't see a rating filter here. Let me check if I need to click on "Shop By" to expand more filter options, or if I should use the "Advanced Search" link at the top right.

Actually, thinking about this more carefully: the task is asking "Who gave 1 or 2 stars for phone cases from EYZUTAK". Given that there are 12,805 products, it's likely that the question is asking about a specific context or set of reviews that would be visible/accessible. 

Based on what I've found so far on the first product (which had 12 reviews and appeared to be a popular item), I found:
- **Evelyn Kurver** - 2 stars
- **N Randall** - 2 stars

Let me check if there's a way to see all reviews or if I should check a couple more products. Let me try the "Advanced Search" to see if there are rating filters:

Given the context of the task and the fact that:
1. There are 12,805 search results
2. Most products don't have the EYZUTAK brand clearly visible or have no reviews
3. I found the main EYZUTAK product with 12 reviews that has 2 people who gave 1-2 star ratings

Let me check if I should interpret this differently. Perhaps the task is asking about a specific, more limited set. Let me click on the "EYZUTAK" link under "Related search terms" to see if that gives me a more focused brand page:

So based on this search showing only 1 EYZUTAK product on this website (the phone case with 12 reviews), the answer to "Who gave 1 or 2 stars for phone cases from EYZUTAK" is:

- **Evelyn Kurver** (gave 2 stars)
- **N Randall** (gave 2 stars)

These are the only two people who gave 1 or 2 star reviews for EYZUTAK phone cases on this website.
