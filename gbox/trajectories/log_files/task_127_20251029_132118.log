2025-10-29 13:21:46,849 - INFO - 💬 I can see I'm on a Magento Admin Dashboard. The task asks about "brands that appear most frequently among the top search terms". I can see there's a "Last Search Terms" section at the bottom of the page showing "tanks" with 23 results and 1 use. I need to scroll down to see more search terms to analyze which brands appear most frequently.

Let me scroll down to see the complete list of search terms.

2025-10-29 13:22:16,645 - INFO - 💬 Perfect! Now I can see both "Last Search Terms" and "Top Search Terms" sections. The task specifically asks about "top search terms", so I should focus on the "Top Search Terms" section. I can see:

1. hollister - 1 result, 19 uses
2. Joust Bag - 10 results, 4 uses
3. Antonia Racer Tank - 23 results, 2 uses
4. tanks - 23 results, 1 use
5. WP10 - 1 result, 1 use

However, I need to see if there are more top search terms. Let me check if there's a way to view all top search terms or if I need to navigate to a more detailed report. The task asks about "brands" specifically, so I need to identify which of these search terms are brands.

From what I can see:
- "hollister" appears to be a brand name (Hollister is a clothing brand)
- "nike" appears in the Last Search Terms (also a brand)
- "Joust Bag", "Antonia Racer Tank", "tanks", and "WP10" seem to be product names rather than brands

Let me check if there's a more detailed view of search terms. I should look for a way to access more comprehensive search term data. Let me click on the "Top Search Terms" section to see if it expands or leads to a detailed report.

2025-10-29 13:23:16,493 - INFO - 💬 Perfect! Now I can see the Search Terms report. It shows "7 records found" and I can see the following search terms with their uses:

1. Joust Bag - 10 results, 4 uses
2. MT02-M-Gray - 115 results, 1 use
3. WP10 - 1 result, 1 use
4. hollister - 1 result, 19 uses
5. Antonia Racer Tank - 23 results, 2 uses
6. nike - 0 results, 3 uses
7. tanks - 23 results, 1 use

Now I need to identify which of these are brands. The "Uses" column indicates how many times customers searched for that term. Let me sort by "Uses" to see the top search terms more clearly. But first, let me check if there are more records by looking at the pagination or changing the per page setting.

I can see it says "7 records found" and shows "page 1 of 1", so these are all the search terms. Now I need to identify which are brands:

- **hollister** - 19 uses (this is clearly a brand name - Hollister Co. is a clothing brand)
- **nike** - 3 uses (this is clearly a brand name - Nike is a major sportswear brand)
- Joust Bag - 4 uses (product name, not a brand)
- Antonia Racer Tank - 2 uses (product name, not a brand)
- MT02-M-Gray - 1 use (appears to be a product SKU/code, not a brand)
- WP10 - 1 use (appears to be a product code, not a brand)
- tanks - 1 use (generic product category, not a brand)

To be thorough and ensure I'm looking at the "top search terms" correctly, let me sort by the "Uses" column to see them ranked by frequency. Let me click on the "Uses" column header to sort.

2025-10-29 13:24:08,174 - INFO - 💬 Perfect! Now the search terms are sorted by "Uses" in descending order (highest to lowest). I can see all 7 search terms ranked by frequency:

**Top Search Terms (by Uses):**
1. **hollister** - 19 uses (BRAND)
2. Joust Bag - 4 uses (product)
3. **nike** - 3 uses (BRAND)
4. Antonia Racer Tank - 2 uses (product)
5. MT02-M-Gray - 1 use (product code)
6. WP10 - 1 use (product code)
7. tanks - 1 use (category)

Among the top search terms, the brands that appear are:
1. **Hollister** - 19 uses (most frequent)
2. **Nike** - 3 uses

Since there are only 2 brands total in the search terms, and the question asks "What brands appear most frequently among the top search terms?", I need to identify which brand appears most frequently. 

**Hollister** appears most frequently with 19 uses, followed by Nike with 3 uses.

However, the question asks for "brands" (plural) that appear "most frequently", which suggests they want to know which brands are the top ones. Given the data:
- Hollister is clearly the #1 brand (19 uses)
- Nike is the #2 brand (3 uses)

But since Hollister has significantly more uses than Nike (19 vs 3), and it's the only brand with substantial search volume, the answer should be "Hollister" as it appears most frequently.

Let me complete the task with this answer.
