The page shows I'm logged in as MarvelsGrantMan136 and I'm currently viewing the home page with Submissions and Comments tabs. I can see there's a message saying "You are not subscribed to any forum. Showing featured forums instead."

To complete the task of thumbs downing the top 5 posts ever in technology, I need to:
1. Navigate to the technology forum
2. Find the "top posts ever" view
3. Downvote the top 5 posts

Let me click on "Forums" to find the technology forum.
