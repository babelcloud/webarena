I notice there's an up/down arrow icon next to the "Sort By" dropdown (↓) which likely controls ascending vs descending order. 

Looking at the products shown, they appear to be expensive furniture items (beds, sofas), which suggests these are high-priced items. This is good - it means they might already be sorted in descending order (highest to lowest). Let me scroll down to see the prices and verify the sort order:

However, I need to show the actual "mouth night guard" listings, not these unrelated expensive items. The search is returning 9819 items because it's matching any of the words "mouth", "night", or "guard". I should use the related search term "mouth guard" link I saw earlier to get more specific results. Let me scroll down a bit to see if there are actual mouth night guard products visible, or I should click on the "mouth guard" related search term:

The issue is that the search is too broad - it's matching any items containing "mouth", "night", OR "guard". I need to search more specifically. Let me scroll back up and try clicking on the "mouth guard" related search term to narrow down the results:

2025-10-26 05:59:35,510 - INFO - 💬 Perfect! I can see the "Related search terms" section with "mouth guard" as one of the options. However, I realize that I need to think about this differently. The task asks me to "show the mouth night guard listings by descending price" - which means I should display/present the current results that are already sorted by descending price.

Looking at the current state:
- The search is for "mouth night guard"
- The results are sorted by Price in descending order (9819 items)
- Items 1-12 are currently displayed

The results ARE already showing mouth night guard listings sorted by descending price. The fact that beds and furniture appear at the top is because the search engine is matching items that contain ANY of these words and showing the most expensive matches first. 

However, to truly show "mouth night guard" products specifically, I should use the more specific search term. Let me click on "mouth guard" to get more relevant results:

These prices appear to be in descending order. However, I'm concerned that the search results for "mouth guard" are including many items that just contain the word "guard" (like "Surface-Guard" mattress).

The prices are continuing to decrease, confirming the descending order. However, these are still furniture items containing "guard" in their names, not actual mouth guards. The original task asked for "mouth night guard" listings, but the "mouth guard" search is too broad as well.

Let me go back to the original "mouth night guard" search by clicking on the related search term link. Let me scroll back up first:

- Search results for: 'mouth night guard'
- Items 1-12 of 9819
- Sort By: Price (with a downward arrow ↓)
- URL contains: `&product_list_order=price`

The products shown are the expensive furniture items (beds, sofas) again, which suggests the sorting is in descending order (highest prices first). However, I notice that by default when you select "Price", it might be sorting in ascending order. Let me scroll down to check the prices and confirm the sort direction:

2025-10-26 06:03:29,868 - INFO - 💬 Excellent! I can now see the prices clearly:
- $28,283.99
- $28,269.99
- $11,083.35
- $8,139.32
- $7,739.22
- $7,149.00
- $6,202.33
- $5,462.95

The prices are in DESCENDING order (highest to lowest), which is exactly what the task requested! The products are sorted by descending price as required. The listings include items that match the search terms "mouth", "night", and "guard" (like "Night Vision" goggles, furniture with "night" in the name, etc.), and they are properly sorted from highest to lowest price.

Now I have successfully completed the task. The "mouth night guard" search results are displayed and sorted by descending price. Let me complete the task:
