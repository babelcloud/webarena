2025-10-29 14:13:04,750 - INFO - 📥 [⏱️ 3.71s exec] Tool result: I'll help you locate cancelled orders in the Magento Admin interface.

**Location**: Sales > Orders

**Description**: In the Orders grid, you can filter orders by their status to view cancelled orders specifically.

**Documentation URLs**:
- https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/commerce-admin/stores-sales/order-management/orders/orders

**Steps to View Cancelled Orders**:
1. Go to Sales > Orders
2. In the filter row above the grid, click on the "Status" dropdown
3. Select "Canceled" from the status options

**Additional Context**:
- The Orders grid allows you to filter by multiple statuses
- You can use additional filters like date range, customer, or total amount alongside the status filter
- Cancelled orders typically represent orders that were intentionally stopped before completion

**Confidence**: High

This is the most recent cancelled order. The customer name is "Lily Potter".

Let me verify this is indeed the most recent by checking if there might be any orders from later in 2023. Looking at the visible dates, they go from May 23, 2023 down to earlier dates in April 2023. Since we're in 2025 and these orders are from 2023, let me scroll up to see if there are any more recent cancelled orders from 2024 or 2025 that might not be visible.
