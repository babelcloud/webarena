   - **Order Status**: Select specific status or leave as "Any"
3. Click **Show Report**

**Period Selection Tip**: IMPORTANT - Change the "Period" dropdown from "Day" to "Month" or "Year" to see cumulative totals efficiently. For your May 2021 to March 2022 date range (11 months), select "Month" peri...
