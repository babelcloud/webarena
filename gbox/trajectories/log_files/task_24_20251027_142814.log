2025-10-27 14:28:55,459 - INFO - 💬 Perfect! I can now see the reviews section. I can see two reviews:

   - Title: "Wonderful!"
   - Rating: 5 stars
   - Review text: "Nothing.....everyday use."

2. **Review by Josef Burger** (Posted on 4/18/23):
   - Title: "Joe"
   - Review text: "Die Haflinger sind wie beschrieben und erwartet sehr gut"

Let me scroll up to see if there are more reviews or if I can see the complete content of these reviews. I need to check carefully if either of these reviews mentions anything about price being unfair.

2025-10-27 14:29:34,694 - INFO - 💬 Perfect! Now I can see both reviews clearly:

**Review 1 - by Jay (Posted on 4/18/23):**
- Title: "Wonderful!"
- Rating: 5 stars
- Review text: "Nothing.....everyday use."

**Review 2 - by Josef Burger (Posted on 4/18/23):**
- Title: "Joe"
- Review text: "Die Haflinger sind wie beschrieben und erwartet sehr gut" (This is German, which translates to "The Haflingers are as described and expected very good")

After carefully reviewing both reviews, I can see that:
- Jay's review mentions "Nothing.....everyday use." - No mention of price being unfair
- Josef Burger's review is in German and says the slippers are "as described and expected very good" - No mention of price being unfair

Neither of these two reviews mentions anything about the price being unfair. Both reviews are positive (5 stars) and neither contains any complaints about pricing.
