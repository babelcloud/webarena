- **Product**: Olivia 1/4 Zip Light Jacket
- **Author**: Emma Lopez (emma.lopez@gmail.com)
- **Summary Rating**: 2 stars (★★☆☆☆)
- **Detailed Rating**: 1 star (★☆☆☆☆)
- **Summary of Review**: "won't recommand"
- **Review**: "I was really disappointed with the Olivia 1/4 Zip Light Jacket. The material is extremely thin and flimsy, which makes it not very warm at all. I was hoping for something that would keep me comfortable in the springtime, but this jacket just doesn't cut it. Additionally, the sizing is way off - I ordered my usual size and it was way too tight in the arms and shoulders. I had to return it and won't be buying from this brand again."

This is a very negative review with only 1 star rating. However, I should check the other reviews to make sure Emma is indeed the MOST unhappy customer. Let me go back and check the other reviews:

- **Detailed Rating**: 3 stars (★★★☆☆)
- **Summary of Review**: "OKish"
- **Review**: "I have to say, I'm not impressed with the Olivia 1/4 Zip Light Jacket. The color is not as vibrant as it looked online, and the zipper is really hard to use. The jacket is also not very breathable, so I found myself getting really sweaty when I wore it for even a short amount of time. Finally, the pockets are really shallow and not very functional. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this jacket - there are better options out there for the price."

- **Summary of Review**: "Quite good"
- **Review**: "I recently purchased the Olivia 1/4 Zip Light Jacket and I am extremely satisfied with my purchase! The jacket is incredibly lightweight and comfortable, making it perfect for cool spring mornings or summer evenings. The 1/4 zip feature allows for easy temperature control, and the jacket is versatile enough to be dressed up or down. I also appreciate the attention to detail in the design - the pockets are well-placed and the stitching is sturdy. Overall, I highly recommend the Olivia 1/4 Zip Light Jacket for anyone in need of a comfortable and stylish lightweight jacket!"

This is a 5-star positive review, so Jane Smith is happy with the product.

2025-10-26 07:54:42,905 - INFO - 💬 I've reached the bottom of the page and I can see the copyright footer. I haven't found any additional Olivia jacket reviews beyond the three I already examined. Let me use a better approach - let me sort the reviews by rating to find the lowest-rated Olivia jacket review. Let me scroll back up and use the filter/sort functionality:

2025-10-26 07:55:15,431 - INFO - 💬 Perfect! I can see the three Olivia jacket reviews again:
- Review #351 by Emma - "won't recommand" - "I was really disappointed with the Olivia 1/4 Z..." - Type: Customer
- Review #349 by seam miller - "OKish" - Type: Guest
- Review #347 by Jane Smith - "Quite good" - Type: Guest

Based on my review of all three reviews for the Olivia 1/4 Zip Light Jacket:

1. **Emma Lopez** - 1 star rating - "won't recommand" - Very negative review with detailed complaints about material being thin/flimsy, sizing issues, had to return it, won't buy from brand again - Type: **Customer** (has email address)

2. **seam miller** - 3 stars - "OKish" - Negative but not as harsh, wouldn't recommend - Type: Guest (no email)

3. **Jane Smith** - 5 stars - "Quite good" - Very positive review - Type: Guest (no email)

Emma Lopez is clearly the most unhappy customer with the Olivia zip jacket, giving it only 1 star and having multiple serious complaints. I already found her email address when I viewed her review: **emma.lopez@gmail.com**
