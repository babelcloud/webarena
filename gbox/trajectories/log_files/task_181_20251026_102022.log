This issue titled "Tm Theme Editor" is currently showing under the "Open" tab, which means it is NOT closed. However, the task asks me to check my "latest created issue" with "theme editor" in the title. Let me check if there are any closed issues by clicking on the "Closed" tab to see if there's a more recent one.

2025-10-26 10:22:43,471 - INFO - 💬 Perfect! Now I can see all issues listed together on the "All" tab:

1. "Thoughts on line highlight?" - Issue #2, created 4 years ago, CLOSED
2. "Tm Theme Editor" - Issue #1, created 5 years ago (no status indicator, meaning it's OPEN), updated 2 years ago

Looking at the issues:
- Issue #1 "Tm Theme Editor" was created 5 years ago
- Issue #2 "Thoughts on line highlight?" was created 4 years ago (more recent)

However, only Issue #1 has "theme editor" in its title. The task asks for "my latest created issue that has theme editor in its title." Since there's only ONE issue with "theme editor" in the title (Issue #1 "Tm Theme Editor"), this must be the one the task is referring to.

Let me click on the "Tm Theme Editor" issue to verify its status and get more details.
