Actually, looking more carefully at the visible orders, I can see one "Complete" order:

But wait, I need to check if there are more recent orders. Looking at the top of the visible list, I see order 000000182 appears to be at the top. Let me scroll back up to see the full list and check if the filter is actually working correctly. I need to find the MOST RECENT completed order.

Looking at the dates, I can see the orders are sorted by Purchase Date in descending order (most recent first):
- 000000230: May 19, 2023 8:11:51 AM - Complete (This is the MOST RECENT completed order!)
- 000000256: May 14, 2023 1:22:46 AM - Complete
- 000000009: May 7, 2023 6:41:05 PM - Complete

So the most recent completed order is **Order ID: 000000230** placed on May 19, 2023 at 8:11:51 AM by Ava Brown with a total of $93.40.

   - Discount Amount: $0.00

2. **Ida Workout Parachute Pant**
   - Original Price: $48.00
   - Price: $38.40
   - Discount Amount: $0.00

Wait, I need to look more carefully. The "Price" column shows $45.00 and $38.40, which are the discounted prices. Looking at the discount amounts, both show $0.00, but the second item's price is $38.40 compared to the original price of $48.00, which means there WAS a discount applied (20% off = $9.60 discount).

Now I need to sort these by discounted price from low to high:
1. **Ida Workout Parachute Pant** - $38.40
2. **Proteus Fitness Jackshirt** - $45.00

The task asks for "product name and discounted price (low to high)" so the answer should be formatted with the products sorted by price from lowest to highest.
