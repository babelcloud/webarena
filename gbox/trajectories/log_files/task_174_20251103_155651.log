I can see several issues with "[Feature suggestion]" in their titles. The list shows:
1. "Tm Theme Editor" - updated 2 years ago
2. "[Feature suggestion] Support linking to an accessibility statement" - updated 2 years ago
3. "[Feature suggestion] WCAG trash panda mode" - updated 2 years ago
4. "[Feature suggestion] Add a submission form" - updated 2 years ago
5. "[Feature suggestion] Color theme slider" - updated 2 years ago
6. "Outdated dependencies" - updated 2 years ago

All of these show "updated 2 years ago". I notice the list is sorted by "Updated date" (I can see the dropdown at the top right). However, I need to look more carefully to see which one is the MOST recently updated. Let me check if I need to scroll down to see more issues, or if I can filter/sort differently to find the latest one.

Actually, looking more carefully at the current sort, the issues are already sorted by "Updated date" (as shown in the dropdown on the right). The issues at the top of the list should be the most recently updated. But they all show "updated 2 years ago". Let me click on the first feature suggestion issue to check its details.

2025-11-03 15:59:28,623 - INFO - 💬 Perfect! Now I'm back at the global Issues dashboard showing all issues across all projects. I can see the issues are sorted by "Updated date" (shown in the dropdown on the right). Looking at the list, I can see several issues with "feature" in their titles, and they all show "updated 2 years ago".

However, I need to look more carefully at the exact timing. The "Updated date" dropdown is showing the current sort. Let me examine the visible feature suggestion issues more closely. Looking at the top of the list, I can see:

1. "Tm Theme Editor" - updated 2 years ago (no "feature" in title)
2. "[Feature suggestion] Support linking to an accessibility statement" - updated 2 years ago
3. "[Feature suggestion] WCAG trash panda mode" - updated 2 years ago
4. "[Feature suggestion] Add a submission form" - updated 2 years ago
5. "[Feature suggestion] Color theme slider" - updated 2 years ago

Since they all show "updated 2 years ago", the first feature suggestion in the list (which is sorted by updated date) should be the most recently updated one. That would be "[Feature suggestion] Support linking to an accessibility statement" at issue #71.

I already checked that issue and saw it was **Open** (not closed). Let me verify this is correct by clicking on it again to double-check its status.

3. **"[Feature suggestion] Add a submission form"** - updated 2 years ago

All feature suggestions show "updated 2 years ago". Since the list is sorted by "Updated date" in descending order (most recent first), and "[Feature suggestion] Support linking to an accessibility statement" is the first feature issue in the list, it should be the most recently updated.

However, I notice all these times say "2 years ago" which is quite vague. Let me click on the "Updated date" dropdown to see if I can get more precise sorting or check if there are more specific timestamps. Actually, I should verify my finding is correct by checking if this is truly the latest. Let me hover over the update time to see if there's a tooltip with more specific information.

2025-11-03 16:01:44,500 - INFO - 💬 The hover didn't show a tooltip. Based on what I can see, the issues list is sorted by "Updated date" and "[Feature suggestion] Support linking to an accessibility statement" is the first feature issue in the list. Since the sort order typically shows most recent first, this appears to be the latest updated feature issue.

I already confirmed that this issue (#71) is **Open** (not closed).

However, to be thorough and ensure I have the correct answer, let me check if there are any feature issues on subsequent pages or if I need to scroll down to see if there are any more recent ones. Let me scroll down to check if there are more issues below.

2025-11-03 16:02:29,174 - INFO - 💬 The page doesn't seem to be scrolling further - I'm seeing the same content. This appears to be all the issues. Looking at the complete list, the feature suggestion issues I can see are:

1. "[Feature suggestion] Support linking to an accessibility statement" #71 - updated 2 years ago
2. "[Feature suggestion] WCAG trash panda mode" #39 - updated 2 years ago
3. "[Feature suggestion] Add a submission form" #30 - updated 2 years ago
4. "[Feature suggestion] Color theme slider" #21 - updated 2 years ago

Since the list is sorted by "Updated date" in descending order (most recent first), and "[Feature suggestion] Support linking to an accessibility statement" is the first feature issue appearing in the list, it is the latest updated issue with "feature" in the title.

I have already verified that this issue (#71) is **Open** (not closed).

Therefore, the answer to the task "Open my latest updated issue that has keyword 'feature' in its title to check if it is closed" is:

**The issue is NOT closed - it is Open.**
