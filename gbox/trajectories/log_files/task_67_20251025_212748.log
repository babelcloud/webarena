2025-10-25 21:33:29,154 - INFO - 💬 Good, I'm back at the top. Now let me analyze the titles to identify which posts likely recommend a single book. Looking at the titles:

1. "The letters of T. S. Eliot to Emily Hale..." - This is about letters, not a book recommendation
2. "Friendly reminder bookshop.org exists." - This is about a website, not a book
3. "Appalachian prison book project..." - This is about a donation project, not a specific book
4. "After Two Decades And 38 Children's Books..." - This mentions 38 books, not a single book
5. "Museum issues appeal to save famed 'Misty of Chincoteague' ranch..." - This mentions "Misty of Chincoteague" which could be a book title
6. "How Ukrainian publishers are fighting to survive" - About publishers, not a specific book
7. "The simple greatness of Agatha Christie" - This is about an author, not a single book
8. "I just finished reading The Hobbit to my 6 year old daughter..." - This mentions "The Hobbit" - a single book!
9. "Apple Books has a free audiobook of A Christmas Carol..." - This mentions "A Christmas Carol" - a single book!

From the titles, I can already identify:
- Post #8: The Hobbit
- Post #9: A Christmas Carol

But I need to check the actual content of these posts to confirm they're recommendations. Let me click on post #8 first.

2025-10-25 21:33:50,293 - INFO - 💬 Perfect! I can see the full post now. This post is about reading "The Hobbit" to the author's daughter. The post mentions:
- "The Hobbit" - this is the single book being recommended
- The author also mentions "the Lord of the Rings book trilogy" but only in passing, saying they mentioned it might not be as interesting

So this post recommends **The Hobbit** as a single book.

2025-10-25 21:39:20,173 - INFO - 💬 Perfect! I can now see the post about Agatha Christie. This is a general discussion about Agatha Christie's writing style and her novels in general. The post talks about "Agatha Christie's novels" (plural) and discusses her general approach to mystery writing. It does NOT recommend a single specific book - it's about the author and her work as a whole.

So post #7 is NOT a single book recommendation.

Now let me go back and review the other posts. Based on my review of the top 10 posts:

1. (3591) "The letters of T. S. Eliot to Emily Hale..." - Not a book recommendation
2. (3085) "Friendly reminder bookshop.org exists." - Not a book recommendation
3. (1716) "Appalachian prison book project..." - Not a book recommendation
4. (1695) "After Two Decades And 38 Children's Books..." - About multiple books
5. (1539) "Museum issues appeal to save famed 'Misty of Chincoteague' ranch..." - News article, not a book recommendation
6. (1434) "How Ukrainian publishers are fighting to survive" - Not a book recommendation
7. (1423) "The simple greatness of Agatha Christie" - About the author in general, not a single book
8. (1423) "I just finished reading The Hobbit..." - ✓ **The Hobbit**
9. (1335) "Apple Books has a free audiobook of A Christmas Carol..." - ✓ **A Christmas Carol**
10. (1334) "What Is It That Makes Used Bookstores So Wonderful?" - About bookstores

So from the top 10 posts, only 2 posts recommend single books:
- **The Hobbit** (post #8)
- **A Christmas Carol** (post #9)
