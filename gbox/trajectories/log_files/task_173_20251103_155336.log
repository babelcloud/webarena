1. "Better initial load experience" - updated 2 years ago
2. "Better sharing solution" - updated 2 years ago

Both show the same update time "updated 2 years ago". Since they appear to have the same relative update time, I need to look more carefully. The issue "Better initial load experience" appears first in the list when sorted by updated date (descending), which means it's the most recently updated one with "better" in the title.

However, looking at both issues, I notice they both have status labels. Let me look at the current visible issues more carefully:
- "Better initial load experience" has labels: [Priority] Low, [Status] Submitted, [Type] Enhancement
- "Better sharing solution" has labels: [Priority] Medium, [Status] Submitted, [Type] Enhancement

Neither of these appears to be closed. Let me click on "Better initial load experience" to check its full status since it's the first one in the updated list.
