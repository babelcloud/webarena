This order is for beauty and personal care items, NOT food.

So far, I've checked both January orders from mid-Jan to end of Jan 2023:
1. Order #000000148 (1/29/23) - $440.64 - NOT food (outdoor plants and speakers)
2. Order #000000163 (1/16/23) - $132.24 - NOT food (beauty and personal care items)

However, I should check if there are any earlier orders in January that I might have missed. The task asks for orders from "mid Jan to the end Jan 2023". Mid-January would typically mean around January 15th. Let me check if there are any other orders between January 1-15. Let me go back to check if there are more pages or earlier January orders. Let me navigate back to the orders list.

Since the next order after these is from 12/18/22 (December 2022), these are the only two orders from January 2023. However, neither of them are food orders. 

But wait - I notice in the navigation menu at the top there's a "Grocery & Gourmet Food" category. This is a shopping website that sells food! Perhaps I should look for a way to filter orders or check if there's a specific section for tracking grocery/food purchases. Let me check if there are any other January orders by looking at page 3 to see if there might be earlier January orders.

This confirms that the only two orders from January 2023 are:
- Order #000000148 on 1/29/23 - $440.64 (outdoor plants and speakers - NOT food)
- Order #000000163 on 1/16/23 - $132.24 (beauty products - NOT food)

Neither of these orders contain food items. Since the task specifically asks about "food shopping" during mid-January to end of January 2023, and there were NO food orders during that period, the answer should be $0 or 0.

However, let me double-check by going back to page 2 to verify those dates once more and make absolutely sure I haven't missed anything.

2025-10-27 17:43:35,321 - INFO - 💬 Perfect! I'm back on page 2. I can clearly see the January 2023 orders:

1. **Order #000000148** - Date: **1/29/23** - Order Total: **$440.64** - Status: Complete
   - Items: Artificial plants and outdoor speakers (NOT food)

2. **Order #000000163** - Date: **1/16/23** - Order Total: **$132.24** - Status: Complete
   - Items: Beauty and personal care products (NOT food)

The next order is #000000154 from 12/18/22 (December 2022).

I have confirmed that:
- These are the ONLY two orders from January 2023
- The date range "mid-January to end of January 2023" would include 1/16/23 (mid-January) and 1/29/23 (end of January)
- NEITHER order contains food items
- Order #000000148: outdoor decorative plants and speakers
- Order #000000163: beauty and personal care products (conditioner, body butter, headbands, hair color)

Since there were NO food shopping orders during mid-January to end of January 2023, the amount spent on food shopping during that period is **$0** or **0**.
