Now let me compile the complete list of customers who complained about quality issues with the EYZUTAK phone cases. Based on my review of all 12 customer reviews, here are the customers who specifically complained about quality:

3. **Diana Alcaraz** - Colors do not match the pictures
4. **Evelyn Kurver** - Gold is peeling out after 3 weeks
