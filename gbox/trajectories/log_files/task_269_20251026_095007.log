Instead of trying to remove the filter, I'll use the Advanced Search feature which might give me more precise control. But actually, looking at the current situation, I realize I should apply multiple specific price filters. However, Magento-style filters typically work with OR logic when you select multiple ranges. Let me instead use a more practical approach - I'll apply the $20.00 - $29.99 filter to see items in that specific range, which includes items under $25. Let me click on that filter.

Actually, let me think about this differently. Since the task asks to "show me products under $25 in women shoes category", I should look at the products currently displayed and identify which ones are under $25. I can see "Amazon Essentials Women's Finley Flat Sandal - $19.50" which is under $25. Let me scroll through the current results to find all women's shoes under $25 and compile a list. But first, let me check if there's a better way to filter specifically for items under $25. Let me try clicking on "$10.00 - $19.99" which would definitely be under $25.

2025-10-26 09:55:20,223 - INFO - 💬 Good! I can see the current results showing shoes in the $10-$19.99 range (647 items). I can see the "Shopping Options" section on the left. However, I realize that I need to think about this task more carefully. 

The task asks me to "Show me products under $25 in women shoes category". I have successfully:
1. ✓ Navigated to the women's category (initially filtered by Women)
2. ✓ Filtered to Shoes category
3. ✓ Applied price filter for $10.00-$19.99 (which shows 647 items under $20)

But I notice the current filter is showing shoes from the general "Shoes" category, not specifically "Women's Shoes". Looking at the items, I can see they are a mix - some say "Women's" in the title, but the category filter doesn't show "Women" anymore in "Now Shopping by". 

Let me check if I need to add back the Women filter. Actually, looking at the URL and the previous actions, I initially selected "Women" category (cat=27), then clicked on "Shoes" which changed to (cat=144). This means I'm now in the general Shoes category, not Women's Shoes specifically.

Let me scroll down a bit to see if there are more category filters available, or I need to use a different approach.

Actually, let me reconsider: when I look at the products displayed, they all appear to be women's shoes based on the product names and images. The "Shoes" category (4019 items) I selected earlier was already under the "Women" parent category. So this should already be showing women's shoes.

Now, to properly show all products under $25, I should also add the $0.00-$9.99 and $20.00-$29.99 price ranges. However, the $20-$29.99 range would include items over $25, so I need to be careful. Since the filters don't allow me to specify exactly "under $25", let me work with what I have and compile the information from the current $10-$19.99 range, which are definitely all under $25.

Actually, let me think about what the user is asking for. They want to see products under $25 in the women shoes category. The current view shows 647 items in the $10-$19.99 range. I should now gather a comprehensive list by scrolling through and documenting the products, or I could also add the $0-$9.99 range to see if there are cheaper options. Let me click on the $0.00-$9.99 filter to add it.
