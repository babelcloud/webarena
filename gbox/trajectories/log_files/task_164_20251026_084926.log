2025-10-26 08:50:29,197 - INFO - 💬 Perfect! I can now see all 3 customer reviews. Let me analyze them to extract the main criticisms:

**Review 1** (5 stars) - by Mary Mir: "Those labial never came to me and I would like them again because I paid for them" - This is a criticism about non-delivery/shipping issue.

**Review 2** (2 stars) - by catherine brown: "DryUneven color" - This is a criticism about the product being dry and having uneven color.

**Review 3** (5 stars) - by Amazon Customer: "Love this lipgloss! Color is gorgeous, texture is perfect. I can't wait to try more products from this company." - This is positive, not a criticism.

The main criticisms are:
1. The product never arrived/shipping issue (Review 1)
2. Dry texture and uneven color (Review 2)

Let me extract the relevant critical sentences:
